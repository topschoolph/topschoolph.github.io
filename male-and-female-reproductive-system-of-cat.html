To attract females</p><p>5.b. wearing long pants and long sleeves outside</p><p>6.a. collects and removes waste</p><p>7.d. cats stay in heat about 10-30 days</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>1.The prostate secretes 20–30% of the seminal fluid which carries the sperm in the ejaculate. The prostate surrounds the urethra below the bladder and can be felt in a rectal exam. Bulbourethral glands produce a pre-ejaculate secretion which lubricates and flushes out the urethra in preparation for the sperm.</p><p></p><p>2.The Female Urethra Is Shorter Than the Male Urethra</p><p>Urine produced in the kidneys passes through the ureters, collects in the bladder, and is then excreted through the urethra.</p><p></p><p>3.Both fishes and frogs reproduce by means of external fertilization. The female releases the egg in water and the male also releases the sperm in water. ... So to maintain a constant rate of fertilization large numbers of eggs are produced by frogs and fishes.</p><p></p><p>4. In most frog species, it is the male sending out the call to mate. He inflates his vocal sacs on his throat, providing an effective chamber to amplify the sound of air rushing across his vocal chords.</p><p></p><p>7.Heat cycles in cats last from several days to two weeks or longer, and repeat every two to three weeks. You can see then, how a female cat may almost always seem to be in heat. ...
