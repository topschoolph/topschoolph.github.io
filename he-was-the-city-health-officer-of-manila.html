What I Have Learned
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire also confirmed the
development in a Viber message to reporters.
Teodoro said they are eyeing to open the testing center on Friday
morning as they still must complete the list of individuals who shall be
prioritized for the testing.
“It may open tomorrow morning. For tonight, we are still
finishing our list of priorities for testing. We will prioritize those with
COVID-19 symptoms, “he said when asked when the laboratory will be
opened for mass testing.
To date, Marikina City has 109 confirmed COVID-19 cases
including 22 patients who recovered and 18 deaths.Marikina City’s
molecular laboratory is located along Bayan Bayanan Avenue in
Barangay Concepcion Uno.
In this news the writer shows, the new testing center has a floor
area of 160 square meters and has no other offices sharing the
building.
The city government earlier planned to establish a testing site on
the sixth floor of Marikina City Health Office but DOH rejected the
proposal because it did not pass biosafety standards for molecular
laboratories that process COVID-19 test samples.</a>

                            1. Write a reaction paper based on the following news article. Manila Mayor visits Bataan, says he is a Bataeno at heart Manila Mayor Isko Moreno paid a courtesy visit to Bataan Gov. Albert S. Garcia at his office in The Bunker in this city last Tuesday. The Manila mayor, who has relatives living in Pilar town in this province, was visiting his sick mother at a hospital here The Manila mayor caused a slight commotion among his fans from the employees at The Bunker who waited for him to arrive. They asked for his autograph and took turns posing for souvenir photos with him. Gov. Garcia and Pilar Mayor Charlie Pizarro met with Mayor Isko and took him on a tour of the Bunker, which serves as the province’s government center and business hub. Garcia explained to Moreno that the Bunker “is a success story for the Public-Private Partnership.” In his two-hour visit, the local chief executives had a productive exchange of ideas and best practices regarding their respective efforts to fight COVID-19 and its effects on livelihood and economyMoreno elaborated on the measures they have put in place in Manila regarding health and education. He said that the construction of a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test laboratory, the establishment of quarantine facilities, and renovating hospitals, and making sure that existing public hospital operations are efficient are vital in the fight against COVID-19. The Manila Mayor also praised the leadership of Garcia in Bataan amidst the COVID crisis. He acknowledged the tremendous challenges everyone faces in this time of the pandemic as a “true test for a public servant.” At one point, Moreno reminisced about his younger days when he used to live as a young man in Pilar town working at a farm. He said, “I will  Municipality of Pilar to enter into a sisterhood agreement as soon as the prevailing health crisis is resolved. pagawan po ng reaction paper. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The recent news article about the Manila Mayor's visit to Bataan caught my attention. It was heartwarming to see how the mayor, despite being from another province, showed great interest and concern for the welfare of Bataan and its people.</p><p></p><p>Mayor Isko Moreno's visit was more than just a courtesy call to the governor; it was a testament to the strong bond he shares with Bataan. Having relatives in Pilar town, he affirmed that he is a "Bataeno at heart." This showed not just his fondness for the place but also his respect for its people.</p><p></p><p>It was impressive how the Bunker served as the province's government center and business hub, proving to be a success story for Public-Private Partnership. As Mayor Moreno toured the Bunker with Gov. Garcia and Pilar Mayor Pizarro, hearing Garcia's efforts amidst the COVID-19 crisis was commendable. As a leader, one should be fearless and always lead by example.</p><p></p><p>The exchange of ideas and best practices between the chief executives was a powerful move to fight against COVID-19 and its impact on livelihood and the economy. I was impressed by the health measures implemented by Mayor Moreno in Manila, such as the establishment of quarantine facilities and renovating hospitals, to ensure efficient public hospital operations. One key takeaway from their conversation was that being a true public servant is not just about leading from the front, but it's about how the critical leadership values and competencies that are necessary to become highly effective agents of change.</p><p></p><p>It was heartening to hear Mayor Moreno reminisce about his younger days when he used to work at a farm in Pilar town. This shows that he values his past experiences and recognizes how crucial they are in shaping one's perspective in life.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when he expressed his aim to enter into a sisterhood agreement with the Municipality of Pilar once the COVID-19 crisis resolves, it showed how keen he is to strengthen the ties between Manila and Bataan.</p><p></p><p>Overall, Mayor Isko Moreno's visit to Bataan highlighted the importance of interprovincial connectivity and cooperation. It was inspiring to see two local chief executives joining hands to fight a common battle against COVID-19. Such actions remind us that we are all in this together, and we must unite to thrive against all odds.</p><p></p><br />

What I Have Learned
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire also confirmed the
development in a Viber message to reporters.
Teodoro said they are eyeing to open the testing center on Friday
morning as they still must complete the list of individuals who shall be
prioritized for the testing.
“It may open tomorrow morning. For tonight, we are still
finishing our list of priorities for testing. We will prioritize those with
COVID-19 symptoms, “he said when asked when the laboratory will be
opened for mass testing.
To date, Marikina City has 109 confirmed COVID-19 cases
including 22 patients who recovered and 18 deaths.Marikina City’s
molecular laboratory is located along Bayan Bayanan Avenue in
Barangay Concepcion Uno.
In this news the writer shows, the new testing center has a floor
area of 160 square meters and has no other offices sharing the
building.
The city government earlier planned to establish a testing site on
the sixth floor of Marikina City Health Office but DOH rejected the
proposal because it did not pass biosafety standards for molecular
laboratories that process COVID-19 test samples.</h2><br />
