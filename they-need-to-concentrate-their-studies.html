What will you do so you can relay these ideas to you siblings or friends who are also answering their modules?""10 STUDY TIPS ON HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR GRADES""1. Organize your study areaBefore you even sit down to study, you have to make sure you get everything one place, so you don't have an excuse to stand and search for it2. Keep a schedule need inGet a large calendar and write down due dates of all your tests, exams, assignments, etc. Place it somewhere near your study area to remind you of the upcoming deadline.3.Make a study goalBefore you sit down to study, write down what you want to accomplish during the study4. Read the textbook First, just read the chapter like you would read a novel. Re-read the chapter much slower,take notes and try to understand the material.5.Make a flash cardsFor classes that require a lot of memorization, prepare flash cards and carry them with you. Every time you have a free minute, review them.6.Use pomodoro techniqueStudy for 25 minutes and take a 5-minute break. You can set a stopwatch in your phone to keep track of the time.7.Reward yourselfReward yourself every time you reach your study goal with something small but enjoyable.8.Turn-off your computerResist the temptation of internet so you can concentrate so much more on the subject you're9.Switch it upBe creative. You don't always have to study at your desk. You can go somewhere. Just put10.Remember the big pictureThere are many reasons why you would want to get a good grade.

                                            Lesson 3: Effects of Noisy EnvironmentOne of the environmental problems that we are facing is having a noisyenvironment which leads to noise pollution brought by industrialization, social events,construction activities, transportation, and household chores.Noise pollution is the excessive sound that causes hearing loss, stress, fatigue,irritability, tension, headache, and high blood pressure. It also causes accidents bypreventing people to concentrate.Sound is an important and valuable part of everyday life. But when soundbecomes noise, it can negatively affect our mental and physical health. The realitiesof modern life mean the noises created in our world are not going to suddenly fallsilent. Instead, we need to recognize that noise pollution is a serious health concernworthy of our attention, and find realistic and sustainable ways to manage and reduceit such as keeping the volume of music, players, and TV at safe levels, avoidinglistening to music through headphones or headsets at unsafe levels, using our fingersto protect our ears if we don't have earplugs, distancing ourselves from loud sounds,and being considerate to others.Directions: Read and answer the questions on your answer sheet. Rubric is given asyour guide to answer.1. Do you want to stay in a noisy environment? Why?2. What are the activities that make your environment noisy? Give at least three.a.b.C.3. As a learner, how does noisy environment affect your studies?pasagot Po thanks​</a>

                                            Directions: Identify which step in planning and designing a research study do the statement belongs. Justify your answer and write it in a separate sheet of paper. 1) The vegetables were pounded with the use of mortar and pestle and filtered through sterilized cheesecloth. The extracts were mixed into the seawater and were tested with the NeuLog pH and Salinity Logger Sensor to determine the pH and the Salinity level before applying. The researcher prepared three treatments; (A) 50 mL of malunggay and 50 mL of seawater. (B) 50 mL Malabar spinach and 50 mL seawater. (C) 25 mL of malunggay, 25 mL Malabar spinach, and 50 mL of seawater. 2) The main objective of this study is to find out the effect of Malunggay (Moringa oleifera) and Malabar Spinach (Basella alba) extract on the salinity level of seawater in watering Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill). 3) Based on the findings, the researcher concluded that Malunggay and Malabar Spinach can be used in reducing the salinity level of seawater for watering Tomato. The result showed that there is no significant difference in using Malunggay and Malabar spinach in terms of reducing the salinity level of water for tomato. Treatment B showed the most effectiveness in watering tomato plants. 4) According to Munns (2012), salinity occurs through natural or human- induced processes that result in the accumulation of dissolved salts in the soil water to an extent that inhibits plant growth. When salt concentration increased, germination of tomato seed was reduced and the time needed to complete germination lengthened (Singh, et.al., 2011). 5) After two (2) weeks, the researcher finalized the measurements. Characteristics namely, the height of the plant (cm), number of leaves, the circumference of the stem (cm), and the number of fruits will be measured. The researcher then acquired the MEAN of Plants A, B, C, and D on the said characteristics from the acquired results on the final analysis.6) There is a significant difference in the varying treatment of Malunggay (Moringa oleifera) and Malabar Spinach (Basella alba) extract to the salinity level of seawater in watering Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill).7) Coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) Sap Vinegar, Acacia (Samanea saman) Seed and Bar Extracts as Coconut Lumber Preservative8) According to the findings of the study after experimenting, coconut sap vinegar is not an effective wood preservative because its acidity varies on the days it is fermented which affects its ability to prevent termite infestation.9) The data obtained by gathering the mean to measure the effectiveness of the varying solutions in terms of the Ability to repel termites. To identify the significant difference of the varying ratios in terms of the Ability to repel Termite, ANOVA or Analysis of Variance was used with the significant value of 0.05. 10) This study states that there was no significant difference among the varying ratios of coconut sap vinegar, acacia seed, and bark extracts on the ability of the coconut lumber to prevent termite infestation after applying the treatment solutions.paki sagot ng maayos please God is watching you​</a>

This results in distraction.2. One solution that some experts suggests is that students need to study withouttechnology for a set period of time.3. However, this requires a lot of discipline and self-control.4. On the other hand, others suggest that technology like apps can also be usedto improve the concentration of students.5.

You interviewed your parents to know what they would buy when they are awarded a million pesos. They told you that they would buy your own house and consistent food supply.Column BA. Between the ages of 4 and 7, children become very interested and ask a lot of questions, indicating that they are starting to use primitive reasoning. There is a resurgence of interest in logic and the need to understand why things are the way they are (Piaget, 1890).B. In a learning mechanism known as classical conditioning, a biologically potent stimulus (e.g. food) is paired with a hitherto neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell) (Pavlov, 1897).C. Centration is the act of concentrating all of one's attention on one aspect or characteristic of a situation while ignoring all others (Piaget, 1890).D. The first stage of Erikson's (1950) theory focuses on how the parents or caregivers meet the infant's basic needs and how this relationship leads to trust or distrust.E. The Mozart effect is the idea that listening to classical music will temporarily improve IQ test scores on one section (Rauscher et al. 1993).F. Social learning theory is a learning and social behavior theory that argues that new habits can be learned by watching and imitating others (Bandura, 1971).G. Operant conditioning is a method of learning that uses incentives and punishments to motivate people to learn. This form of conditioning assumes that an action and a result, such as a reward or punishment, have a causal relationship that leads to learning (Skinner, 1938).H. The physiological need, according to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (1954), is a term developed to clarify and cultivate the basis for motivation. The key physical prerequisite for human existence is this definition.I. Rather than describing intelligence as a single, general capacity, the theory of multiple intelligences suggests that human intelligence be divided into distinct "modalities of intelligence" (Gardner, 1983).FOR THE LAST HELP ME, I NEED TO SUMBIT THIS TODAY HOPE U CAN HELP ME​</a>

Video games have been blamed for problems ranging from thumb injuries to low test scores. Detactors of the games complain that they are noisy and flashy, that they involve players so completely that other activities are neglected and that they don't offer physical exercise. These critics, however, are overlooking the benefits Video games help us sharpen the skills that are useful in more serious activities. First these noisy, flashy games train us to ignore distractions. We must keep our minds on what we're doing despite the blinking lights and mechanical noises. This ability helps us when we need to work of concentate despite the honking homs, warning sirens, humming refrigerators, and flickering neon signs that form the background of our lives. In this loud and lively age, we need all the practice we can get in blocking out distractions Second, as we play, we learn to concentrate on and deal with a number of different elements. If we don't we lose right away. Once this skill is developed, it is likely to spill over into more important activities, like studying or putting together projects. In other words, video games improve our ability to process information. Finally, video games give us one essential kind of physical exercise: we get practice in coordinating what our eyes see with what our hands do. This form of coordination makes some academic skills, such as copying From the chalkboard or taking notes for reports, much easier. Of course, good handeye coordination is also vital for important mechanical skills, like driving. Playing video games, therefore, is an enjoyable form of self-improvement. It's wiser to spend a few quarters developing concentration and coordination than buying a bubble gum. Prototype Lesson Plan in English, Third Year​</a>

Mental illnesses are common in the United States. More than 50 million Americans struggle with mental illness (Mental Health America: Adult Data 2022. Accessed January 25, 2023) and 1 in 5 young people (age 13-18) has or will develop a mental illness in their lifetime. (Mental Health Facts: Children and Teens." National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2017. Accessed May 7, 2019) The prevalence of common mental disorders is on the rise among the populations of western industrial nations (Twenge et al., 2010, Hidaka, 2012). A strong link has been found between mental and physical health (Nabi et al., 2008, Surtees et al., 2008). Ohrnberger, Fichera and Sutton (2017) find strong cross-effects between physical and mental health even after controlling for confounders. However, studies show that exercise can treat mild to moderate depression as effectively as antidepressant medication-but without the side-effects, of course. As one example, a recent study done by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that running for 15 minutes a day or walking for an hour reduces the risk of major depression by 26%. In addition to relieving depression symptoms, research also shows that maintaining an exercise schedule can prevent you from relapsing. Physical exercise has also been proven to have a positive effect on mental health. It can also help with concentration and focus, which are important for academic success. According to the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), physical activity has an impact on cognitive skills such as concentration and attention, and it also enhances classroom attitudes and behaviours, all of which are important components of improved academic performance. Exercising regularly can also help students stay physically healthy, which in turn helps them stay mentally healthy as well. Exercise releases endorphins that make us feel good and energized throughout the day. The American College of Cardiology recently conducted a study that revealed that children with high levels of leadership skills and empathy were “more likely to care about their own health, perhaps adopting life-long healthy behaviors that can prevent heart disease.” A study from the University of Illinois also showed that children who are physically fit are more likely to perform better in school and achieve higher grades Therefore, people who are dealing with mental health problems needs physical exercise. ​</a>

Justify your answer and write it in a separate sheet of paper 1) The vegetables were pounded with the use of mortar and pestle and filtered through sterilized cheesecloth. The extracts were mixed into the seawater and were tested with the NeuLog pH and Salinity Logger Sensor to determine the pH and the Salinity level before applying. The researcher prepared three treatments; (A) 50 mL of malunggay and 50 mL of seawater. (B) 50 mL Malabar spinach and 50 mL seawater. (C) 25 mL of malunggay, 25 mL Malabar spinach, and 50 mL of seawater. 2) The main objective of this study is to find out the efect of Malunggay (Moringa oleifera) and Malabar Spinach (Basella alba) extract on the salinity level of seawater in watering Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill). 3) Based on the findings, the researcher concluded that Malunggay and Malabar Spinach can be used in reducing the salinity level of seawater for watering Tomato. The result showed that there is no significant difference in using Malunggay and Malabar spinach in terms of reducing the salinity level of water for tomato. Treatment B showed the most effectiveness in watering tomato plants. 4) According to Munns (2012), salinity occurs through natural or human- induced processes that result in the accumulation of dissolved salts in the soil water to an extent that inhibits plant growth. When salt concentration increased, germination of tomato seed was reduced and the time needed to complete germination lengthened (Singh, et.al., 2011). 5) After two (2) weeks, the researcher finalized the measurements. Characteristics namely, the height of the plant (cm), number of leaves, the circumference of the stem (cm), and the number of fruits will be measured. The researcher then acquired the MEAN of Plants A, B, C, and D on the said characteristics from the acquired results on the final analysis.​</a>

Lesson 3: Effects of Noisy EnvironmentOne of the environmental problems that we are facing is having a noisyenvironment which leads to noise pollution brought by industrialization, social events,construction activities, transportation, and household chores.Noise pollution is the excessive sound that causes hearing loss, stress, fatigue,irritability, tension, headache, and high blood pressure. It also causes accidents bypreventing people to concentrate.Sound is an important and valuable part of everyday life. But when soundbecomes noise, it can negatively affect our mental and physical health. The realitiesof modern life mean the noises created in our world are not going to suddenly fallsilent. Instead, we need to recognize that noise pollution is a serious health concernworthy of our attention, and find realistic and sustainable ways to manage and reduceit such as keeping the volume of music, players, and TV at safe levels, avoidinglistening to music through headphones or headsets at unsafe levels, using our fingersto protect our ears if we don't have earplugs, distancing ourselves from loud sounds,and being considerate to others.Directions: Read and answer the questions on your answer sheet.

Justify your answer and write it in a separate sheet of paper. 1) The vegetables were pounded with the use of mortar and pestle and filtered through sterilized cheesecloth. The extracts were mixed into the seawater and were tested with the NeuLog pH and Salinity Logger Sensor to determine the pH and the Salinity level before applying. The researcher prepared three treatments; (A) 50 mL of malunggay and 50 mL of seawater. (B) 50 mL Malabar spinach and 50 mL seawater. (C) 25 mL of malunggay, 25 mL Malabar spinach, and 50 mL of seawater. 2) The main objective of this study is to find out the effect of Malunggay (Moringa oleifera) and Malabar Spinach (Basella alba) extract on the salinity level of seawater in watering Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill). 3) Based on the findings, the researcher concluded that Malunggay and Malabar Spinach can be used in reducing the salinity level of seawater for watering Tomato. The result showed that there is no significant difference in using Malunggay and Malabar spinach in terms of reducing the salinity level of water for tomato. Treatment B showed the most effectiveness in watering tomato plants. 4) According to Munns (2012), salinity occurs through natural or human- induced processes that result in the accumulation of dissolved salts in the soil water to an extent that inhibits plant growth. When salt concentration increased, germination of tomato seed was reduced and the time needed to complete germination lengthened (Singh, et.al., 2011). 5) After two (2) weeks, the researcher finalized the measurements. Characteristics namely, the height of the plant (cm), number of leaves, the circumference of the stem (cm), and the number of fruits will be measured. The researcher then acquired the MEAN of Plants A, B, C, and D on the said characteristics from the acquired results on the final analysis.6) There is a significant difference in the varying treatment of Malunggay (Moringa oleifera) and Malabar Spinach (Basella alba) extract to the salinity level of seawater in watering Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill).7) Coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) Sap Vinegar, Acacia (Samanea saman) Seed and Bar Extracts as Coconut Lumber Preservative8) According to the findings of the study after experimenting, coconut sap vinegar is not an effective wood preservative because its acidity varies on the days it is fermented which affects its ability to prevent termite infestation.9) The data obtained by gathering the mean to measure the effectiveness of the varying solutions in terms of the Ability to repel termites. To identify the significant difference of the varying ratios in terms of the Ability to repel Termite, ANOVA or Analysis of Variance was used with the significant value of 0.05. 10) This study states that there was no significant difference among the varying ratios of coconut sap vinegar, acacia seed, and bark extracts on the ability of the coconut lumber to prevent termite infestation after applying the treatment solutions.paki sagot ng maayos please God is watching you​</h2><br />

You interviewed your parents to know what they would buy when they are awarded a million pesos. They told you that they would buy your own house and consistent food supply.Column BA. Between the ages of 4 and 7, children become very interested and ask a lot of questions, indicating that they are starting to use primitive reasoning. There is a resurgence of interest in logic and the need to understand why things are the way they are (Piaget, 1890).B. In a learning mechanism known as classical conditioning, a biologically potent stimulus (e.g. food) is paired with a hitherto neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell) (Pavlov, 1897).C. Centration is the act of concentrating all of one's attention on one aspect or characteristic of a situation while ignoring all others (Piaget, 1890).D. The first stage of Erikson's (1950) theory focuses on how the parents or caregivers meet the infant's basic needs and how this relationship leads to trust or distrust.E. The Mozart effect is the idea that listening to classical music will temporarily improve IQ test scores on one section (Rauscher et al. 1993).F. Social learning theory is a learning and social behavior theory that argues that new habits can be learned by watching and imitating others (Bandura, 1971).G. Operant conditioning is a method of learning that uses incentives and punishments to motivate people to learn. This form of conditioning assumes that an action and a result, such as a reward or punishment, have a causal relationship that leads to learning (Skinner, 1938).H. The physiological need, according to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (1954), is a term developed to clarify and cultivate the basis for motivation. The key physical prerequisite for human existence is this definition.I. Rather than describing intelligence as a single, general capacity, the theory of multiple intelligences suggests that human intelligence be divided into distinct "modalities of intelligence" (Gardner, 1983).FOR THE LAST HELP ME, I NEED TO SUMBIT THIS TODAY HOPE U CAN HELP ME​</h2><br />

Video games have been blamed for problems ranging from thumb injuries to low test scores. Detactors of the games complain that they are noisy and flashy, that they involve players so completely that other activities are neglected and that they don't offer physical exercise. These critics, however, are overlooking the benefits Video games help us sharpen the skills that are useful in more serious activities. First these noisy, flashy games train us to ignore distractions. We must keep our minds on what we're doing despite the blinking lights and mechanical noises. This ability helps us when we need to work of concentate despite the honking homs, warning sirens, humming refrigerators, and flickering neon signs that form the background of our lives. In this loud and lively age, we need all the practice we can get in blocking out distractions Second, as we play, we learn to concentrate on and deal with a number of different elements. If we don't we lose right away. Once this skill is developed, it is likely to spill over into more important activities, like studying or putting together projects. In other words, video games improve our ability to process information. Finally, video games give us one essential kind of physical exercise: we get practice in coordinating what our eyes see with what our hands do. This form of coordination makes some academic skills, such as copying From the chalkboard or taking notes for reports, much easier. Of course, good handeye coordination is also vital for important mechanical skills, like driving. Playing video games, therefore, is an enjoyable form of self-improvement. It's wiser to spend a few quarters developing concentration and coordination than buying a bubble gum. Prototype Lesson Plan in English, Third Year​</h2><br />

Mental illnesses are common in the United States. More than 50 million Americans struggle with mental illness (Mental Health America: Adult Data 2022. Accessed January 25, 2023) and 1 in 5 young people (age 13-18) has or will develop a mental illness in their lifetime. (Mental Health Facts: Children and Teens." National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2017. Accessed May 7, 2019) The prevalence of common mental disorders is on the rise among the populations of western industrial nations (Twenge et al., 2010, Hidaka, 2012). A strong link has been found between mental and physical health (Nabi et al., 2008, Surtees et al., 2008). Ohrnberger, Fichera and Sutton (2017) find strong cross-effects between physical and mental health even after controlling for confounders. However, studies show that exercise can treat mild to moderate depression as effectively as antidepressant medication-but without the side-effects, of course. As one example, a recent study done by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that running for 15 minutes a day or walking for an hour reduces the risk of major depression by 26%. In addition to relieving depression symptoms, research also shows that maintaining an exercise schedule can prevent you from relapsing. Physical exercise has also been proven to have a positive effect on mental health. It can also help with concentration and focus, which are important for academic success. According to the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), physical activity has an impact on cognitive skills such as concentration and attention, and it also enhances classroom attitudes and behaviours, all of which are important components of improved academic performance. Exercising regularly can also help students stay physically healthy, which in turn helps them stay mentally healthy as well. Exercise releases endorphins that make us feel good and energized throughout the day. The American College of Cardiology recently conducted a study that revealed that children with high levels of leadership skills and empathy were “more likely to care about their own health, perhaps adopting life-long healthy behaviors that can prevent heart disease.” A study from the University of Illinois also showed that children who are physically fit are more likely to perform better in school and achieve higher grades Therefore, people who are dealing with mental health problems needs physical exercise. ​</h2><br />

Justify your answer and write it in a separate sheet of paper 1) The vegetables were pounded with the use of mortar and pestle and filtered through sterilized cheesecloth. The extracts were mixed into the seawater and were tested with the NeuLog pH and Salinity Logger Sensor to determine the pH and the Salinity level before applying. The researcher prepared three treatments; (A) 50 mL of malunggay and 50 mL of seawater. (B) 50 mL Malabar spinach and 50 mL seawater. (C) 25 mL of malunggay, 25 mL Malabar spinach, and 50 mL of seawater. 2) The main objective of this study is to find out the efect of Malunggay (Moringa oleifera) and Malabar Spinach (Basella alba) extract on the salinity level of seawater in watering Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill). 3) Based on the findings, the researcher concluded that Malunggay and Malabar Spinach can be used in reducing the salinity level of seawater for watering Tomato. The result showed that there is no significant difference in using Malunggay and Malabar spinach in terms of reducing the salinity level of water for tomato. Treatment B showed the most effectiveness in watering tomato plants. 4) According to Munns (2012), salinity occurs through natural or human- induced processes that result in the accumulation of dissolved salts in the soil water to an extent that inhibits plant growth. When salt concentration increased, germination of tomato seed was reduced and the time needed to complete germination lengthened (Singh, et.al., 2011). 5) After two (2) weeks, the researcher finalized the measurements. Characteristics namely, the height of the plant (cm), number of leaves, the circumference of the stem (cm), and the number of fruits will be measured. The researcher then acquired the MEAN of Plants A, B, C, and D on the said characteristics from the acquired results on the final analysis.​</h2><br />
