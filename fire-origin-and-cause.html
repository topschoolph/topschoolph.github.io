                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1. C <p>—A hazard is a situation that poses a level of potential threat or risk, to life, health, property, or environment. Most hazards are dormant or potential, with only a theoretical risk of harm; however, once a hazard becomes "active," it can create an emergency situation.</p>2. B <p>—Risk is the probability that exposure to a hazard will lead to a negative consequence, or more simply, a hazard poses no risk if there is no exposure to that hazard. Risk can be defined as the likelihood or probability of a given hazard of a given level causing a particular level of loss of damage.</p>3. A<p>—A physical hazard is a naturally occurring process that has the potential to create loss or damage. Physical hazards include earthquakes, floods, fires, and tornadoes.</p>4. D<p>—A biological hazard is one originating from an organism that is foreign (in presence or concentration) to the organism being affected. Many biological hazards are associated with food, including certain viruses, parasites, fungi, bacteria, and plant and seafood toxins.</p>5. D <br />
