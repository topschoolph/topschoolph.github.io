You have two lungs that work together with various other parts of your body. The lungs work together with your heart to draw in oxygen, which is carried by red blood cells across your body.A large muscle called the diaphragm works with your lungs to get air in and out of yourbody. It rests just below your lungs, near the upper part of your belly. Air then travelsdown the trachea, the pharynx, and the larynx in that order before passing through twolarge tubes called bronchi.These large tubes look like trees, expanding and branching out into the spongy part of your left or right lung. Your rib cage is especially important, as it protects this delicate system.As the primary organs of our respiratory system, the lungs' many functions are quiteimpressive!Main Idea|---------------------------------------------||.                                                   ||.                                                   ||---------------------------------------------|Supporting Details↓Supporting Details↓Supporting DetailsAdditional supporting details.​</a>

This is over and above the predicted level oftide. Storm surge takes place where winds are blowing on shore Thehighest surge tends to occur where the strongest winds of the hurricaneor storm are. That is why, people are highly alerted or warned of suchoccurrence, especially those living along the coastal areas. Storm surgescan damage property and can claim people's lives.2. Earthworms have long, segmented bodies, covered in microscopic setae,or bristles, which help to anchor and pull the worm via longitudinalmuscle contractions.3.

DIRECTIONS: Listen to the passage as your guardian, sibling, teacher reads it Fill out the Main Idea chart.Did you know your lungs are the second largest organ in your body? You have two lungs that work together with various other parts of your body. The lungs work together with your heart to draw in oxygen, which is carried by red blood cells across your body.A large muscle called the diaphragm works with your lungs to get air in and out of yourbody. It rests just below your lungs, near the upper part of your belly. Air then travelsdown the trachea, the pharynx, and the larynx in that order before passing through twolarge tubes called bronchi.These large tubes look like trees, expanding and branching out into the spongy part of your left or right lung. Your rib cage is especially important, as it protects this delicate system.As the primary organs of our respiratory system, the lungs' many functions are quiteimpressive!Main Idea|---------------------------------------------||.                                                   ||.                                                   ||---------------------------------------------|Supporting Details↓Supporting Details↓Supporting DetailsAdditional supporting details.​</h2><br />

This is over and above the predicted level oftide. Storm surge takes place where winds are blowing on shore Thehighest surge tends to occur where the strongest winds of the hurricaneor storm are. That is why, people are highly alerted or warned of suchoccurrence, especially those living along the coastal areas. Storm surgescan damage property and can claim people's lives.2. Earthworms have long, segmented bodies, covered in microscopic setae,or bristles, which help to anchor and pull the worm via longitudinalmuscle contractions.3. How to make pork curry: heat oil and sauté pork with garlic, onion, porkbroth cube and curry. Add eggplant and red pepper. Pour evaporatedmilk and season chili sauce.4. Water is important.

The process of digestion starts in the mouth. 5. The presence of villi and microvilli in small intestine decreases the surface area for the absorption of nutrients. 6. During the absorption process, the nutrients are being absorbed by each cell of the body in the form of energy. 7. Undigested parts of the food are eliminated from the body in the form of urine. 8. The passage of food from mouth to the stomach is aided by the contraction of muscles in the esophagus. 9. There is a thick layer of mucus in the lining of stomach that protects the tissue from the strong acid. 10.
