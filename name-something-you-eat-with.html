She introduced Bea first to her mother. After this, Ana's mother named Elsa prepared sandwiches for a snack while Ana was helping her. As they were busy preparing in the kitchen Ana smelled something. It was the ripe jackfruit wrapped in the sack under the table. Ana couldn't wait to eat as she smelled the ripe jackfruit. When her mother permitted her, she then took a knife and sliced it. She made four slices and spared one slice for Bea. The rest of the slices were shared with her siblings. Ana went to their small sala with a slice of jackfruit to be shared with her classmate, but Bea refused to take it because she was eating a sandwich, so Ana got a piece of jackfruit. While they were eating Ana has noticed that the seeds of jackfruit on her hand were cracked and the roots were sprouted. Then, she got another one and continued eating but the same things happened. Bea also tried to pick one piece but the seed she got was different from Ana. It was a healthy seed. After their snacks, Ana and Bea cleaned the table to start doing their project. When Bea left after they were done with their project, Ana threw the jackfruit peal and she buried the healthy seeds on the potted plant. After three weeks she was amazed that the seeds she buried have started to germinate. Ana prepared a space for transplanting the seedlings. She chose a shed or partially shaded place for seedlings. The seedlings grew healthy because she watered it every day. Ana had a new friend to be taken care of and protected to grow and bear more fruits, these were the "Jackfruit seedling". From the story you have read, answer the following questions to better understand the content of this module as we go along:1.

                                            Piolo Pascual: The frugal, private person behind the bankable movie star. Everybody knows Piolo Pascual. In a nutshell, the story tells the bittersweet tale of a 19-year old overseas Filipino who had to work double shifts and 16-hour duties as a hospital worker by day and a security guard at night just to make ends meet. At present, he is the endorser of BDO Remit. In one of its webinars, Piolo talks about the importance of saving and how a movie star like him has been managing his finances during the quarantine period. "Saving has been an important practice in our family. When I was in school and began working, it was the practical thing to do. You save up for things you want to buy. If you have money saved, you will have something to bank on when unexpected situations happen, such as this pandemic. I knew I had to set aside something for a rainy day and save money that I can use when I do not have anything else. So, ever since I started working, puro savings na talaga ako, I made sure I was not sure spending beyond what I could afford. I never changed my lifestyle. I have always lived a simple life," Piolo said. "I invested in farming because it is a nice feeling to grow your own crops or eat your own produce. Nag-invest ako sa mga bagay na pwede mong paikutin. I now have 18 chickens na galling sa farm ko para yun na lang ang kakainin naming. Mas nakakatipid ka pa. We were going to sell them during the lockdown dahil ang dami na ngang manok. So, they were not just for us. We also share them with friends," Piolo added. Questions to ponder: Analyze Piolo's testimony on his saving and spending experience?

4. I am light and seem to have no substance at all. But even the strongest person in the world can’t hold me for very long. What am I?
5. I don’t have money, though I do have banks. I feed others, though I don’t eat. Cross me if you can, I won’t be mad. What am I?

7. You are always living in me. No matter how much time goes by I am still right there with you. What am I?

9. How should you satisfy your sweet tooth when it’s way after bedtime?
10. My name seems harsh, but I am still and silent. You are supposed to eat me, but some display me. My name is not easy to do to me because I am hard on the outside. What am I?</a>

Then, answer the questions that follow.Text 1Why Do We Get "Brain Freeze?"Brain Freeze" is that sharp, short-lasting headache one gets when eating or drinking something very cold like an icecream or shakes on a hot day. Also known as "ice cream headache" or "frozen brain syndrome," brain freeze affects aboutone-third of the population and does not occur during cool weather.The pain occurs when the brain's blood vessels dilate. The dilation is likely the result of the stimulation of a nerve center,located above the roof of your mouth, reaching to the cold stimulus. The nerve center overacts, causing the pain. You canenjoy a tasty ice cream treat, but you should try to keep it away from your mouth.Source: Perez, Rosita M (2007). Quest for Reading Treasures Skill Kit 5. Marikina City.

She introduced Bea first to her mother. After this, Ana's mother named Elsa prepared sandwiches for a snack while Ana was helping her. As they were busy preparing in the kitchen Ana smelled something. It was the ripe jackfruit wrapped in the sack under the table. Ana couldn't wait to eat as she smelled the ripe jackfruit. When her mother permitted her, she then took a knife and sliced it. She made four slices and spared one slice for Bea. The rest of the slices were shared with her siblings. Ana went to their small sala with a slice of jackfruit to be shared with her classmate, but Bea refused to take it because she was eating a sandwich, so Ana got a piece of jackfruit. While they were eating Ana has noticed that the seeds of jackfruit on her hand were cracked and the roots were sprouted. Then, she got another one and continued eating but the same things happened. Bea also tried to pick one piece but the seed she got was different from Ana. It was a healthy seed. After their snacks, Ana and Bea cleaned the table to start doing their project. When Bea left after they were done with their project, Ana threw the jackfruit peal and she buried the healthy seeds on the potted plant. After three weeks she was amazed that the seeds she buried have started to germinate. Ana prepared a space for transplanting the seedlings. She chose a shed or partially shaded place for seedlings. The seedlings grew healthy because she watered it every day. Ana had a new friend to be taken care of and protected to grow and bear more fruits, these were the "Jackfruit seedling".

                            11. Piolo Pascual: The frugal, private person behind the bankable movie star. Everybody knows Piolo Pascual. In a nutshell, the story tells the bittersweet tale of a 19-year old overseas Filipino who had to work double shifts and 16-hour duties as a hospital worker by day and a security guard at night just to make ends meet. At present, he is the endorser of BDO Remit. In one of its webinars, Piolo talks about the importance of saving and how a movie star like him has been managing his finances during the quarantine period. "Saving has been an important practice in our family. When I was in school and began working, it was the practical thing to do. You save up for things you want to buy. If you have money saved, you will have something to bank on when unexpected situations happen, such as this pandemic. I knew I had to set aside something for a rainy day and save money that I can use when I do not have anything else. So, ever since I started working, puro savings na talaga ako, I made sure I was not sure spending beyond what I could afford. I never changed my lifestyle. I have always lived a simple life," Piolo said. "I invested in farming because it is a nice feeling to grow your own crops or eat your own produce. Nag-invest ako sa mga bagay na pwede mong paikutin. I now have 18 chickens na galling sa farm ko para yun na lang ang kakainin naming. Mas nakakatipid ka pa. We were going to sell them during the lockdown dahil ang dami na ngang manok. So, they were not just for us. We also share them with friends," Piolo added. Questions to ponder: Analyze Piolo's testimony on his saving and spending experience? How it has influenced your view on managing finances? Use another sheet of paper for your answer.​</h2><br />

Also known as "ice cream headache" or "frozen brain syndrome," brain freeze affects aboutone-third of the population and does not occur during cool weather.The pain occurs when the brain's blood vessels dilate. The dilation is likely the result of the stimulation of a nerve center,located above the roof of your mouth, reaching to the cold stimulus. The nerve center overacts, causing the pain. You canenjoy a tasty ice cream treat, but you should try to keep it away from your mouth.Source: Perez, Rosita M (2007). Quest for Reading Treasures Skill Kit 5. Marikina City.
