Climate change is the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a place. Climate change could refer to a particular location or the planet as a whole. Climate change may cause weather patterns to be less predictable. These unexpected weather patterns can make it difficult to maintain and grow crops in regions that rely on farming because expected temperature and rainfall levels can no longer be relied on. Climate change has also been connected with other damaging weather events such as more frequent and more intense hurricanes, floods, downpours, and winter storms.

                                            Climate change is the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a place. Climate change could refer to a particular location or the planet as a whole. Climate change may cause weather patterns to be less predictable. These unexpected weather patterns can make it difficult to maintain and grow crops in regions that rely on farming because expected temperature and rainfall levels can no longer be relied on. Climate change has also been connected with other damaging weather events such as more frequent and more intense hurricanes, floods, downpours, and winter storms.

                        <p>Question Number 5:</p><p>A change that is affected with the factor of duration and only exists in a short period is called:<strong> C. FAD</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Question Number 6:</p><p>It is a characteristic observed in one item that may be repeated in similar or identical manner in another items. It is: <strong>A. PATTERN</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>EXPLANATION OF FAD AND TREND:</strong></p><p>In recent years, there has been an assumption that a <strong>trend</strong> is something that has quite a negative connotation. "Ah, it's just a <strong>trend</strong>, its time will pass." Such sentences often appear when many businesses try to present something new, which immediately gets the attention of consumers, and 'explodes'. In fact, according to the true meaning of the <strong>trend</strong> is a development or change in society that occurs in a long time and slowly.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, something that quickly "explodes" and disappears instantly is referred to as <strong>fad</strong>. In the business landscape, fad is known as a form of enthusiasm for something that is intense and usually rises suddenly. Generally fad lasts a short time. For some business people, fad is often used as an opportunity to make a profit. Because they know the potential of consumers who are crazy about a fad, often businesses take advantage of this by issuing products that are in line with the fad. Actually it is not something bad. There is nothing wrong if we want to take advantage of a fad. But what must be remembered is that the fad<strong> </strong>duration is so short that it requires businesses to be able to move faster in reading the market. Just a few weeks late, it could be no longer relevant because consumers have started to leave the fad.</p><p></p><p><strong>EXPLANATION OF PATTERS:</strong></p><p><strong>Pattern</strong> is the basic structure that arranges the surface in a consistent and orderly manner. The pattern can be described as an infinitely repeating form. the simplest pattern is the repetition of the shape of the box and the shape of the square block that is vertical or horizontal. pattern focuses on repeating the same object. Patterns can be created in different components which are then repeated the same way throughout the design. While Seamless Pattern or in Indonesian <strong>"Seamless Pattern"</strong> is flawless. This pattern is a seamless pattern from beginning to end of the design, the whole pattern is a coherent whole.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Learn more about <strong>why development trends are important in developing a mobile application​:</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/10998710</p><p></p><p>#SPJ6</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:What is a Paragraph?</strong></p><p><strong>A paragraph is a group of sentences that convey an idea. Each sentence works together as part of a unit to create an overall thought or impression. A paragraph is the smallest unit or cluster of sentences in which one idea  can be developed adequately. Paragraphs can stand alone or function as part of an essay, but each paragraph covers only one main idea.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The most important sentence in your paragraph is the topic sentence, which clearly states the subject of the whole paragraph. The topic sentence is usually the first sentence of the paragraph because it gives an overview of the sentences to follow. The supporting sentences after the topic sentence help to develop the main idea. These sentences give specific details related to the topic sentence. A final or concluding sentence often restates or summarizes the main idea of the topic sentence.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Effective Paragraphs</strong></p><p><strong>An effective parapraph contains:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>a topic sentence that states the main point of the paragraph</strong></p><p><strong>supporting sentences with details and specific examples as proof of your point</strong></p><p><strong>logical, coherent thoughts that are developed in order from one sentence to the next</strong></p><p><strong>a concluding idea that wraps up the point of the paragraph</strong></p><p><strong>Below is a paragraph model. It contains a topic sentence with concrete details and examples in the supporting sentences. Notice how the writer sums up the point of the paragraph with a concluding sentence.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Also, because this is academic writing, the writer indents the first line five spaces to mark the beginning of a paragraph. This practice is not always followed in commercial or instructive writing, or in business letters or memos.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>My First Day</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>        My first day of college was a disaster. First, I went to the wrong classroom for math. I was sitting in the class, surrounded by people taking notes and paying attention to how to do equations, which would have been okay if I was supposed to be in an algebra class. In reality, I was supposed to be in geometry, and when I discovered my error, I had already missed the first twenty minutes of a one-hour class. When I got to the correct class, all twenty-five students turned and looked at me as the teacher said, "You're late." That would have been bad enough, but in my next class my history teacher spoke so fast I could not follow most of what they said. The only thing I did hear was that we were having a quiz tomorrow over today’s lecture. My day seemed to be going better during botany class, that is, until we visited the lab. I had a sneezing fit because of one of the plants in the lab and had to leave the room. When I finally finished my classes for the day, I discovered I had locked my keys in the car and had to wait for my brother to bring another set. My first day of school was so bad that I know the rest will have to be better.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In the above paragraph, the topic sentence appears in bold and the concluding sentence in italics. The sentences in between support and develop the topic sentence by giving specific examples and details.

                        <p><strong>Answer:<br />Climate change is happening now. Evidences being seen support the fact that the change cannot simply be explained by natural variation. The most recent scientific assessments have confirmed that this warming of the climate system since the mid-20th century is most likely to be due to human activities; and thus, is due to the observed increase in greenhouse gas concentrations from human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and land use change. Current warming has increasingly posed quite considerable challenges to man and the environment, and will continue to do so in the future. Presently, some autonomous adaptation is taking place, but we need to consider a more pro-active adaptation planning in order to ensure sustainable development.<br /><br /></strong><strong>Hope i can help you!</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Climate Change </p><p>Climate change is a global phenomenon that is affecting the long-term temperature and weather patterns of different regions across the world. As a result, these changes have implications for many aspects of human life and the natural environment. </p><p></p><p>One potential impact of climate change on human life is its negative impact on agriculture. Due to changes in temperature and rainfall patterns, farmers in regions that rely on agriculture are finding it difficult to maintain and grow their crops. This could lead to food scarcity and insecurity, particularly in developing countries where food production is an important source of income and livelihood. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, climate change has been linked to more frequent and severe weather events such as hurricanes, floods, downpours, and winter storms. These weather events pose significant threats to people's safety, homes, and livelihoods. For instance, the increasing frequency of extreme weather events has led to more frequent and intense floods and droughts, which can lead to displacement of people and loss of property. </p><p></p><p>In conclusion, climate change is a serious issue that has far-reaching consequences for our planet and its inhabitants.

                            28. Why are changes in production and consumption patterns needed toachieve sustainable development?​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Society and economy revolve around demand and supply, production and consumption. It can be either of two ways -- a certain demand of the public spurs on new ideas for companies to try, or a certain product comes out in the market and brings light to a need or want that the consumers did not know they had. If the demand of the people is supported by the producers' supply, that means that the consumers' needs and wants are sustained. However, like everything else in life, nothing stays the same -- changes and adjustments in production and consumption patterns are needed in order to keep the economy growing and not fall stagnant. It also gives way to innovations and improvements to different products. </p><p></p><p>These patterns are also needed to change so that the resources can be used more efficiently and can leave less harm on the environment than they did before. If that happens, then there will be sustainable development.</p><br />
