                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1. BOY2. YES3. 50%4. Y chromosome5. X and Y6. AGE<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>1. Every egg has an X sex chromosome; a sperm can have either an X or a Y sex chromosome. If the sperm that fertilizes your egg has an X chromosome, you'll have a girl; if it has a Y chromosome, your baby will be a boy.2. If a sperm with an X chromosome fertilizes the egg, the new cell will have two X chromosomes. One came from the father's sperm and one came from the mother's egg. Since the sex chromosome that is made is XX, the cell will grow into a girl baby.3.if a male and female organism bred the chance of the offspring becoming a male will always be 50%4.The X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes in humans (the other is the Y chromosome). The sex chromosomes form one of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes in each cell.5.The sex chromosomes are referred to as X and Y, and their combination determines a person's sex. Typically, human females have two X chromosomes while males possess an XY pairing. This XY sex-determination system is found in most mammals as well as some reptiles and plants.6.Various studies show that factors such as age (17), gender (19), race (14, 20) and marital status (14) can affect the different aspects of sexual self-concept. Also, sexually transmitted diseases (21), schizophrenia and depression (22) can also affect people's sexual self-concept.<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>X </strong><strong>chromosome </strong><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sorry maali po kasi sinabi kanina sa 2 eh</p><br />

The information literacy landscape through which an individual moves is shaped by external factors as well as a range of personal attributes and perceptions. The information literacy mind map below attempts to bring these factors together.The diagram illustrates the complexity of the information literacy landscape. It is not meant to be comprehensive, but to act as a starting point for debate and discussion. If we want to develop information literate students, we need to be aware that the landscape in which they are developing will be influenced by a wide range of different factors. Each individual will have a slightly different perspective on the landscape from their peers, so any information literacy teaching needs to be flexible and to allow for different responses. Too rigid an approach may result in an individual losing the way through their own personal information literacy environment. Click on the diagram below to see a full size image.
