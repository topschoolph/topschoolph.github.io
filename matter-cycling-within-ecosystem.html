                                            Matter generally cycles through ecosystems. For example, trees use nutrients in the soil to make leaves. When leaves fall to the ground, the nutrients stored in the leaves return to the soil and are reused. However, not all the materials that plants use to make leaves are recycled within the ecosystem. Describe how two materials that trees need come from outside of the tree’s ecosystem and leave the ecosystem after they are used.</a>

Every organism needs molecules like proteins, carbohydrates, and fats to provide the raw building materials for their cells.</p><p></p><p>One of the most fascinating facts about Earth is that almost all the matter on the planet today has been here since Earth first formed. That means all the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements that make up the molecules of living things have been recycled over and over throughout time. Consequently, ecologists say that matter cycles through ecosystems.</p><br />

                            9. Matter generally cycles through ecosystems. For example, trees use nutrients in the soil to make leaves. When leaves fall to the ground, the nutrients stored in the leaves return to the soil and are reused. However, not all the materials that plants use to make leaves are recycled within the ecosystem.

Carbon dioxide: Carbon dioxide enters the tree's ecosystem when trees take in this gas from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. After the tree has used the carbon dioxide to make leaves, some of it is released back into the atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>2. Water: Water enters the tree's ecosystem when it rains or when the tree is watered. Water is absorbed by the roots and used to make leaves.
