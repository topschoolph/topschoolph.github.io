                                            What's In Read the poem below about tenses. Understand the poem as there are questions to be answered afterwards. Tense up with English Tenses Almost every day I learn my English And it is not as easy as it seems My brain really cannot finish And now verbs are coming up in my dreams. I was learning the past progressive But that didn't last And I always turned aggressive For, up jumped the simple past. I had expected to be a little faster The past perfect I had wanted to get I would have been a real master If the conditional had not made me upset. The present perfect I hadn't respected Though you can believe me how I've tried The progressive I have been attempting To the rules I have myself tied. They say the future won't either be easy Of that sentence I'm quite certain But I'm going to make an effort, really I don't want it to be another burden. But the thing that keeps me going As I'm fighting with each tense Is that maybe in the future It will perhaps make some kind of sense. (Seni77 2014) What is the poem about? What tenses of the verb were mentioned in the poem? Which of the underlined verbs express present action? What words express action done in the past? Which word expresses future action?

                            6. What's In Read the poem below about tenses. Understand the poem as there are questions to be answered afterwards. Tense up with English Tenses Almost every day I learn my English And it is not as easy as it seems My brain really cannot finish And now verbs are coming up in my dreams. I was learning the past progressive But that didn't last And I always turned aggressive For, up jumped the simple past. I had expected to be a little faster The past perfect I had wanted to get I would have been a real master If the conditional had not made me upset. The present perfect I hadn't respected Though you can believe me how I've tried The progressive I have been attempting To the rules I have myself tied. They say the future won't either be easy Of that sentence I'm quite certain But I'm going to make an effort, really I don't want it to be another burden. But the thing that keeps me going As I'm fighting with each tense Is that maybe in the future It will perhaps make some kind of sense. (Seni77 2014) What is the poem about? What tenses of the verb were mentioned in the poem? Which of the underlined verbs express present action? What words express action done in the past? Which word expresses future action?
