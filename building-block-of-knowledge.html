                                            Activity 1: What Is Research? Direction: Determine further the meaning and function of research by reading the porographs beow. In doing so. arrange the jumbled letters of some terms to understand research even better. When researchers are interested in examining o problem using a scientific approach, it is said that they are doing a (1.) SARREECH. The people who are being studied ore colled (2.) BUJECIS. The person who oversees the research is called the (3.) PRINCEL P investigator. The building blocks of theories are called (4.) CEPCONTS. An abstract generalization that presents a systematic representation about relationships among phenomena is called (5.) HEROYI. The concepts that are studied are called (6) BARIALE V. The concept that is being studied that usually that usually indicates the influence or cause is called the (7.) DENTIN PEEND variable. The concept that the researcher is most interested in understanding is caled the (8.) TEENNPED D vanabe. Vorobes that may influence or contaminate the data are called (9.) E OUTS X A ER N variables. If the group that is being studied is very different or vaned, the group is said to be (10.) GENES HEROTEO U while groups that are very similor are called (11.) HOOMNE E G OU S groups. When studying variables, definitions must be clarified. A variable such as anxiety may be defined as a feeing of uneasiness: this is called a (12.) CEPTAL CUON definition. To measure anxiety, the State-Traite Anxiety Scoe might be used. A (13.) SY SITHEPH O is a statement written by the researcher that states the relationship among or between variables. There are two major categones for research designs. One design the (14) QUALNIVALETI approach uses data that has numerical representation or values. The second design. (15.) QUATL VE ALTI uses norrative data. (16.) DEDUCE ViTreasoning is the basis for quantitative approach. The bond or connection between two variables is colled a (17.) ORIEN TALHIPS. Research that is conducted to generate knowledge that influences or improves practice is coled (18.) D E ALIPP research. Research that tests theories is known as (9.) ASCIB research.​</a>

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable. The decaying process takes place with the help of bacteria and fungi, which are known as decomposers. Materials that do not decay are known as nonbiodegradable. These materials can clog drainage and can cause water and land pollution._______3. One afternoon, Emmanuel’s class adviser handed him a letter sealed in a small envelope and told him to give it to his parents. The boy went home and gave the envelope to his mother. His mother read the letter. Emmanuel was qualified for a full scholarship next school year in one of the prestigious schools in their town. His mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy._________4. The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower. Cross-pollination occurs if the transfer is from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower of the same kind.II. A.

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable. The decaying process takes place with the help of bacteria and fungi, which are known as decomposers. Materials that do not decay are known as nonbiodegradable. These materials can clog drainage and can cause water and land pollution._______3. One afternoon, Emmanuel’s class adviser handed him a letter sealed in a small envelope and told him to give it to his parents. The boy went home and gave the envelope to his mother. His mother read the letter. Emmanuel was qualified for a full scholarship next school year in one of the prestigious schools in their town. His mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy._________4. The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower. Cross-pollination occurs if the transfer is from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower of the same kind.II. A.

Do this in your notebook. Personal Experiences Possible Literary Elements to be used UKA MD Knowing your prior knowledge about literary elements and the possible sources of contents using your personal experiences will help you create your own samples of literary elements based on your experiences. You have known already that literary elements are the things that all literatures-whether it is a news article, a book, or a poem-absolutely have to have. Just like a house, the elements might be arranged slightly different. But at the end of the day, they are usually all present and accounted for. Literary elements are the fundamental building blocks of writing. They play an important role in helping us write, read and understand literature. Hartgers (2020) defined literary elements as writing techniques used to create artistic special effects, that immerse the reader into a narrative, story, or text. Literary elements are specific ways that storytellers use words in specific patterns to tell their stories. They are considered as main tools in a writer's toolbox. Popular literary devices include allusion, diction, foreshadowing, imagery, metaphors, similes and personification.​</a>

In doing so. arrange the jumbled letters of some terms to understand research even better. When researchers are interested in examining o problem using a scientific approach, it is said that they are doing a (1.) SARREECH. The people who are being studied ore colled (2.) BUJECIS. The person who oversees the research is called the (3.) PRINCEL P investigator. The building blocks of theories are called (4.) CEPCONTS. An abstract generalization that presents a systematic representation about relationships among phenomena is called (5.) HEROYI. The concepts that are studied are called (6) BARIALE V. The concept that is being studied that usually that usually indicates the influence or cause is called the (7.) DENTIN PEEND variable. The concept that the researcher is most interested in understanding is caled the (8.) TEENNPED D vanabe. Vorobes that may influence or contaminate the data are called (9.) E OUTS X A ER N variables. If the group that is being studied is very different or vaned, the group is said to be (10.) GENES HEROTEO U while groups that are very similor are called (11.) HOOMNE E G OU S groups. When studying variables, definitions must be clarified. A variable such as anxiety may be defined as a feeing of uneasiness: this is called a (12.) CEPTAL CUON definition. To measure anxiety, the State-Traite Anxiety Scoe might be used. A (13.) SY SITHEPH O is a statement written by the researcher that states the relationship among or between variables. There are two major categones for research designs. One design the (14) QUALNIVALETI approach uses data that has numerical representation or values. The second design. (15.)

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable. The decaying process takes place with the help of bacteria and fungi, which are known as decomposers. Materials that do not decay are known as nonbiodegradable. These materials can clog drainage and can cause water and land pollution._______3. One afternoon, Emmanuel’s class adviser handed him a letter sealed in a small envelope and told him to give it to his parents. The boy went home and gave the envelope to his mother. His mother read the letter. Emmanuel was qualified for a full scholarship next school year in one of the prestigious schools in their town. His mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy._________4. The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower. Cross-pollination occurs if the transfer is from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower of the same kind.II. A.

Do this in your notebook. Personal Experiences Possible Literary Elements to be used UKA MD Knowing your prior knowledge about literary elements and the possible sources of contents using your personal experiences will help you create your own samples of literary elements based on your experiences. You have known already that literary elements are the things that all literatures-whether it is a news article, a book, or a poem-absolutely have to have. Just like a house, the elements might be arranged slightly different. But at the end of the day, they are usually all present and accounted for. Literary elements are the fundamental building blocks of writing. They play an important role in helping us write, read and understand literature. Hartgers (2020) defined literary elements as writing techniques used to create artistic special effects, that immerse the reader into a narrative, story, or text. Literary elements are specific ways that storytellers use words in specific patterns to tell their stories. They are considered as main tools in a writer's toolbox. Popular literary devices include allusion, diction, foreshadowing, imagery, metaphors, similes and personification.​</h2><br />
