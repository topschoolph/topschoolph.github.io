                                            Even before paper was invented, drawings were already made on rocks, wood, animal skins, and even on wide leaves. Those done on rocks could be seen in caves inhabited by prehistoric humans. Drawings that appear on the walls and ceilings of caves found in France, Spain, Libya, and other countries would show hunting scenes. Today, some primitive peoples still continue this art. The aborigines of Arnhem found in Austra- lia draw on rock cliffs and tree barks, while the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa carve pictures on rocks. Drawing is still necessary in many art forms. Before a picture is painted, a batik design is made, or a chinaware is decorated, a drawing or sketch must first be done. In buildings and other construction projects, architects and engineers need drawings of plans before any construction begins. In the fashion world, designers make a sketch and then draw a pattern before a dress or suit is tailored. Whether as an art or as a work plan, drawing plays a vital role in man's daily life. 1. 2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>I fully agree with the idea that "Everything changes". This is an undeniable truth that has been proven time and time again throughout history. Change is a fundamental part of life and the environment, and it is essential for life to thrive. Abiotic factors such as rainfall, sunlight, pollution, volcanic eruptions, and weathering are all examples of how change is constantly occurring. Some of these changes are man-made, while others are natural, and some may be advantageous while others are destructive. However, no matter the form, change is inevitable and necessary for the environment to remain healthy.</p><br />

                            27. Even before paper was invented, drawings were already made on rocks, wood, animal skins, and even on wide leaves. Those done on rocks could be seen in caves inhabited by prehistoric humans. Drawings that appear on the walls and ceilings of caves found in France, Spain, Libya, and other countries would show hunting scenes. Today, some primitive peoples still continue this art. The aborigines of Arnhem found in Austra- lia draw on rock cliffs and tree barks, while the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa carve pictures on rocks. Drawing is still necessary in many art forms. Before a picture is painted, a batik design is made, or a chinaware is decorated, a drawing or sketch must first be done. In buildings and other construction projects, architects and engineers need drawings of plans before any construction begins. In the fashion world, designers make a sketch and then draw a pattern before a dress or suit is tailored. Whether as an art or as a work plan, drawing plays a vital role in man's daily life. 1. 2.
