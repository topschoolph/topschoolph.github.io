I was sitting in the class, surrounded by people taking notes and paying attention to how to do equations, which would have been okay if I was supposed to be in an algebra class. In reality, I was supposed to be in geometry, and when I discovered my error, I had already missed the first twenty minutes of a one-hour said, "You're late* That would have been bad enough, but in my next class my history teacher spoke so class When I got to the correct class, all twenty-five students turned and looked at me as the teacher fast I could not follow most of what they said. The only thing I did hear was that we were having a quiz tomorrow over today's lecture. My day seemed to be going better during botany class, that is, until we visited the lab. I had a sneezing fit because of one of the plants in the lab and had to leave the room When I finally finished my classes for the day, I discovered I had locked my keys in the car and had to wait for my brother to bring another set. My first day of school was so bad that I know the rest will have to be better.

In reality, I was supposed to be in geometry, and when I discovered my error, I had already missed the first twenty minutes of a one-hour said, "You're late* That would have been bad enough, but in my next class my history teacher spoke so class When I got to the correct class, all twenty-five students turned and looked at me as the teacher fast I could not follow most of what they said. The only thing I did hear was that we were having a quiz tomorrow over today's lecture. My day seemed to be going better during botany class, that is, until we visited the lab. I had a sneezing fit because of one of the plants in the lab and had to leave the room When I finally finished my classes for the day, I discovered I had locked my keys in the car and had to wait for my brother to bring another set. My first day of school was so bad that I know the rest will have to be better.
