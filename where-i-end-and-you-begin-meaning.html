The Origin of Rice and Streams (Ibaloy Tale) Once upon a time, there were two blind women. They were kindhearted, but they were very poor. In order to eat, they had to beg from their neighbors and sometimes they were driven away or given nothing. Nevertheless, they did not complain but went on living each day as best as they could. Once when they had no food for some time, they decided to walk to the next village to try their luck there. They walked slowly, feeling footholds among the hilly paths. When they had walked some distance, they bumped into a large rock. The impact sent their bodies reeling. Dazed, they held on to each other and tried to get back on their feet. But they had gone too long without food, and now they could not even stand. The rock opened magically, and out of its granite depths a young woman emerged. She took the two blind women by the hand and let them inside. An old woman seated them at a stone table and gave them food to eat. "Now tell what you need," said the old woman to them when they had finished their meal. One of the blind women said, "I am always hungry. I need food, but I am too blind and I cannot work for a living in the fields." The other replied, "I am always thirsty. I always need something to drink, but I, too, am blind and I cannot find my way even to the smallest spring." The old woman gave the first woman a sack of rice that would never be empty. To the other she gave a bottle of water that would never be drained dry. They both thanked the old woman profusely and they felt their way back home. They lived together happily, never wanting any more than what they already had. After some time, though, they told each other that it was not right to keep to themselves the good fortune that they had been given. So, the one who owned the magic sack of rice took a handful of grain and sowed it; when the grain was harvested she gave it to the people in the village. The one who owned the magic bottle poured some of the water out onto the land where it changed into many small brooks and streams. On their banks flowers soon grew, and to the streams people came to fetch water for their various needs.

                                            CONCEPT NOTES ABOUT THE LITURGICAL CALENDARAdvent: First Sunday of Advent through December 24thAdvent begins the Sunday closest to the feast of St. Andrew, which is November 30th. Therefore Advent always falls sometime between November 28th and December 3rd, and lasts until the Nativity of the Lord. The season always has somewhere between 21 and 28 days.The Advent season is the time of waiting and preparing for the coming of Jesus. This refers both to the anniversary celebration of the Incarnation, as well as the second and final coming for which we are waiting and preparing. The liturgical colors of Advent are Purple and Rose, with Rose being used only on the third Sunday of Advent.Christmas: December 25th through The Feast of the Baptism of the LordThe Christmas season begins with the celebration of the birth of Jesus, Christmas day, or as a vigil on Christmas Eve. The Feast of Christmas lasts 12 days, until Epiphany. However, the time from Epiphany until the Baptism of the Lord is also included in the Christmas season. Traditionally, Epiphany had been fixed to January 6th, and the Baptism celebrated on the octave of Epiphany, which was January 13th. In most countries, the Epiphany is now celebrated on the Sunday closest to January 6th, and the Baptism celebrated the following Sunday. The Christmas season is a time of rejoicing in the Incarnation. The liturgical color of Christmas is white.Ordinary Time after the Baptism: Monday after the Feast of the Baptism through Shrove TuesdayAfter the celebration of the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord, Ordinary Time begins. Ordinary does not mean plain. The name comes from “ordinalis” meaning "showing order, denoting an order of succession.” It is used in this sense to refer to the order of the counted weeks. That is to say, it is a season of counted weeks. Ordinary Time after the Baptism focuses on the early life and childhood of Christ, and then on His public ministry. The liturgical color of Ordinary Time is green; however, as in all seasons, other appropriate colors are worn on particular feast days. (For example, white is typically worn for Marian feast days, except in some Spanish countries where blue is an approved liturgical color.)Lent: Ash Wednesday through Holy SaturdayThe season of Lent begins with Ash Wednesday and lasts until the final Saturday before Easter, Holy Saturday. Lent is a penitential season. It recalls the 40 days Jesus spent in the desert, and the 40 years the Israelites wandered in the desert. Lent focuses on the events leading up to Christ’s passion, and finally on the Passion itself. Lent is 40 days long. This does not include Sundays, as Sunday is always a day for rejoicing in the Resurrection. Altogether, it covers 46 calendar days, the 40 days plus the six Sundays. The liturgical colors of Lent are violet or purple, traditionally more of a red-violet color than the deep purple of Advent. Rose may also be used, where it is the custom, on Laetare Sunday (Fourth Sunday during Lent). On Passion Sunday (Palm Sunday) and on Good Friday (which has no Mass but a service remembering Christ’s passion) the color is red. White or violet is worn on Holy Thursday and Holy Saturday (once again, there is no Mass but there are other services on Holy Saturday).Easter: Easter Vigil though PentecostThe Easter season begins with the Easter Vigil, which is celebrated after night falls on the evening before Easter Sunday. The season of Easter is a joyous, celebratory season. It begins with celebrating Christ’s resurrection and ends by celebrating the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus. Christ’s ascension into Heaven is celebrated just prior to Pentecost. The Easter season last 50 days, from Easter Sunday through Pentecost. The liturgical colors of Easter are white, for most days, and red for Pentecost.Ordinary Time after Pentecost: The day after Pentecost through the final day before Advent(See the above section on Ordinary Time for the history of the term)The second period of Ordinary Time is the longest liturgical season. Ordinary Time resumes after Pentecost and runs until the final Saturday before Advent. This period of Ordinary Time focuses on Christ’s reign as King of kings, and on the age of the Church. This is the age we live in now, which is the time between the age of the Apostles and the age of Christ’s second and final coming for which we are ever preparing. The final Sunday in Ordinary Time is the Feast of Christ the King; the Saturday after this feast is the final day of Ordinary time. Again, the liturgical color of Ordinary Time is green; however, as in all seasons, other appropriate colors are worn on particular feast days.Pa summarize po please I begging you</a>

                                            what is this poem all about? SHAMAN (for the Sukdan of Inabanga) By: Dr. Ulysses B. Aparece We both believe in this: place As either timed or timeless. A constant watchman though I am, I still dare cross the far boundaries In search of the other side of space. Gatherer of leaves, root, stones, you are The keeper of the ancient craft of touch Extending welcome to a new realm Where begins the travel of remembering. So I gain entrance to this great beyond, I must admit I carry a baggage for you To unburden, these fruits of my living. You thus begin your shaman’s journey On my body, a vast geography of frightened Muscles, bones, nerves, joints, veins. Your hands whisper the secrets of gabun, Kulavu, tanglad, kugang-kugan…. Green residences of gentle duwendes. Skill of hands untangles invisible knots In my stomach, quieting down murmurs Of the heart; yours is a sweet gurgle Of rivulets, breath of earth and forest: Mutya sa Kuampang, mutya sa Panghagban Mutya sa Matinlig, mutya sa Puwawan… Strange prayer that never really matters. The means is the message, a message, Until your crystals proclaim this portent: The world I left in one certain moment Has followed me with much vengeance, Now shakes your space from fossilized sleep. O great healer of fear—medicine man, Tambalan, oracionan, baylan, sukdan— What has happened to your knowing hands, Can’t they resist with open palms these Beastly creatures, maps of hardest structures? Where are your spirit familiars? Your canticles from the sanctuary called heart Cannot outlast the monster’s roars lording Over bleeding shrubberies, drowning Your place’s whispers, breezes sighs. How, in the end, you have become Your own province, of silence: red rivulets, Purple boundaries, capital wound. Mine, now, is the knowing touch of duty, Filling the void, wishing to connect, Sending you off, never letting go.​</a>

The Origin of Rice and Streams (Ibaloy Tale) Once upon a time, there were two blind women. They were kindhearted, but they were very poor. In order to eat, they had to beg from their neighbors and sometimes they were driven away or given nothing. Nevertheless, they did not complain but went on living each day as best as they could. Once when they had no food for some time, they decided to walk to the next village to try their luck there. They walked slowly, feeling footholds among the hilly paths. When they had walked some distance, they bumped into a large rock. The impact sent their bodies reeling. Dazed, they held on to each other and tried to get back on their feet. But they had gone too long without food, and now they could not even stand. The rock opened magically, and out of its granite depths a young woman emerged. She took the two blind women by the hand and let them inside. An old woman seated them at a stone table and gave them food to eat. "Now tell what you need," said the old woman to them when they had finished their meal. One of the blind women said, "I am always hungry. I need food, but I am too blind and I cannot work for a living in the fields." The other replied, "I am always thirsty. I always need something to drink, but I, too, am blind and I cannot find my way even to the smallest spring." The old woman gave the first woman a sack of rice that would never be empty. To the other she gave a bottle of water that would never be drained dry. They both thanked the old woman profusely and they felt their way back home. They lived together happily, never wanting any more than what they already had. After some time, though, they told each other that it was not right to keep to themselves the good fortune that they had been given. So, the one who owned the magic sack of rice took a handful of grain and sowed it; when the grain was harvested she gave it to the people in the village. The one who owned the magic bottle poured some of the water out onto the land where it changed into many small brooks and streams. On their banks flowers soon grew, and to the streams people came to fetch water for their various needs.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This Ibaloy tale is structured in a traditional folktale format, beginning with the introduction of two blind women who are poor and must beg for food. The plot then follows their journey to the next village, where they encounter a magical rock that opens up and reveals an old woman who gives them a sack of rice and bottle of water that will never be empty or drained dry. The story ends with the two women sharing their good fortune with others by sowing some of the rice and pouring out some of the water, which turns into small streams. </p><p></p><p>The point of view is third person omniscient, as it allows readers to understand what is happening from both characters' perspectives. The major characters are the two blind women, while minor characters include the old woman from within the rock and those in their village who benefit from their generosity. </p><p></p><p>The actions taken by these characters include walking to another village, bumping into a large rock, being given food by an old woman inside it, receiving gifts from her (a sack of rice and bottle of water), returning home happily together afterwards, sowing some grain from one's sack and pouring out some water from one's bottle so that it turns into small streams for others to use. </p><p></p><p>Literary devices used in this story include imagery (the hilly paths they walk on) as well as personification (the rock opening magically). These devices help create meaning by providing vivid descriptions that bring life to this tale about how kindness can be rewarded through generosity towards others.</p><br />

                            11. CONCEPT NOTES ABOUT THE LITURGICAL CALENDARAdvent: First Sunday of Advent through December 24thAdvent begins the Sunday closest to the feast of St. Andrew, which is November 30th. Therefore Advent always falls sometime between November 28th and December 3rd, and lasts until the Nativity of the Lord. The season always has somewhere between 21 and 28 days.The Advent season is the time of waiting and preparing for the coming of Jesus. This refers both to the anniversary celebration of the Incarnation, as well as the second and final coming for which we are waiting and preparing. The liturgical colors of Advent are Purple and Rose, with Rose being used only on the third Sunday of Advent.Christmas: December 25th through The Feast of the Baptism of the LordThe Christmas season begins with the celebration of the birth of Jesus, Christmas day, or as a vigil on Christmas Eve. The Feast of Christmas lasts 12 days, until Epiphany. However, the time from Epiphany until the Baptism of the Lord is also included in the Christmas season. Traditionally, Epiphany had been fixed to January 6th, and the Baptism celebrated on the octave of Epiphany, which was January 13th. In most countries, the Epiphany is now celebrated on the Sunday closest to January 6th, and the Baptism celebrated the following Sunday. The Christmas season is a time of rejoicing in the Incarnation. The liturgical color of Christmas is white.Ordinary Time after the Baptism: Monday after the Feast of the Baptism through Shrove TuesdayAfter the celebration of the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord, Ordinary Time begins. Ordinary does not mean plain. The name comes from “ordinalis” meaning "showing order, denoting an order of succession.” It is used in this sense to refer to the order of the counted weeks. That is to say, it is a season of counted weeks. Ordinary Time after the Baptism focuses on the early life and childhood of Christ, and then on His public ministry. The liturgical color of Ordinary Time is green; however, as in all seasons, other appropriate colors are worn on particular feast days. (For example, white is typically worn for Marian feast days, except in some Spanish countries where blue is an approved liturgical color.)Lent: Ash Wednesday through Holy SaturdayThe season of Lent begins with Ash Wednesday and lasts until the final Saturday before Easter, Holy Saturday. Lent is a penitential season. It recalls the 40 days Jesus spent in the desert, and the 40 years the Israelites wandered in the desert. Lent focuses on the events leading up to Christ’s passion, and finally on the Passion itself. Lent is 40 days long. This does not include Sundays, as Sunday is always a day for rejoicing in the Resurrection. Altogether, it covers 46 calendar days, the 40 days plus the six Sundays. The liturgical colors of Lent are violet or purple, traditionally more of a red-violet color than the deep purple of Advent. Rose may also be used, where it is the custom, on Laetare Sunday (Fourth Sunday during Lent). On Passion Sunday (Palm Sunday) and on Good Friday (which has no Mass but a service remembering Christ’s passion) the color is red. White or violet is worn on Holy Thursday and Holy Saturday (once again, there is no Mass but there are other services on Holy Saturday).Easter: Easter Vigil though PentecostThe Easter season begins with the Easter Vigil, which is celebrated after night falls on the evening before Easter Sunday. The season of Easter is a joyous, celebratory season. It begins with celebrating Christ’s resurrection and ends by celebrating the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus. Christ’s ascension into Heaven is celebrated just prior to Pentecost. The Easter season last 50 days, from Easter Sunday through Pentecost. The liturgical colors of Easter are white, for most days, and red for Pentecost.Ordinary Time after Pentecost: The day after Pentecost through the final day before Advent(See the above section on Ordinary Time for the history of the term)The second period of Ordinary Time is the longest liturgical season. Ordinary Time resumes after Pentecost and runs until the final Saturday before Advent. This period of Ordinary Time focuses on Christ’s reign as King of kings, and on the age of the Church. This is the age we live in now, which is the time between the age of the Apostles and the age of Christ’s second and final coming for which we are ever preparing. The final Sunday in Ordinary Time is the Feast of Christ the King; the Saturday after this feast is the final day of Ordinary time. Again, the liturgical color of Ordinary Time is green; however, as in all seasons, other appropriate colors are worn on particular feast days.Pa summarize po please I begging you</h2><br />

These are times when conscious attention is given to the mysterious forces that surround and involve all living creatures in the natural and inexorable cycles of light and darkness; labour and rest; birth, growth, decay, and death.</p><p></p><p>Two interrelated cycles have had primary importance in the shaping of religious calendars. One is cosmic: the phases of the moon and the solar equinoxes and solstices. The other is the periodic succession of the seasons of nature that determines times of sowing and reaping. Both cycles speak to the mystery of birth, death, and rebirth and to human dependence upon the fecundity of life given in the natural creation.</p><p></p><p>Jewish background</p><p>The Jewish religious year, grounded in the divinely revealed Law of the Hebrew Bible, was the foundation for the church year of Christians. It is a lunar-month calendar stemming from the primitive nomadic life of the Hebrews, with its chief festival at the first full moon of spring, known later as the Passover. Grafted onto this calendar after the settlement of the Hebrew tribes in Palestine were the agricultural festivals—dependent upon “the early and later rains”—the firstfruits at Passover, the first harvest at Shavuot, or the Festival of Weeks, and the autumn harvest at Sukkoth, or the Feast of Tabernacles or Booths.</p><p></p><p>Get a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.</p><p>Subscribe Now</p><p>Of uncertain origin, but prior to the monarchical period (11th–6th century BCE), the Hebrews observed a seven-day week, of which the last day, or sabbath, was a holiday and day of rest. Whatever its original purpose, it became transformed into a sacral day, consecrated to Yahweh, the one God of the Hebrews, and increasingly surrounded with restrictions upon all activity other than worship. In the time of Jesus (1st century CE), “keeping holy the sabbath day” was a principal hallmark of adherence to Judaism.</p><p></p><p>The remarkable aspect of the Jewish religious year was its transformation, in successive codifications of the Torah, into a series of historical commemorations associated with God’s deed in creation and in the redemption of God’s people. At first the sabbath was related to the Exodus, the deliverance of the Hebrews from Egypt in the 13th century BCE (Deuteronomy 5:15) and, later, to the repose of God at the completion of the Creation (Exodus 20:8–11; Genesis 2:2–3). The three agricultural feasts became a sequence of remembrances of the Exodus from Egypt and the pilgrimage through the wilderness to the promised land (Exodus 12:1–20; Leviticus 23; Deuteronomy 16:1–17). Through these annual celebrations Jews relived the saving events of the past and anticipated the final deliverance of the people of God in the age to come. Rabban Gamaliel, a contemporary of Jesus, said, “In every generation a man must so regard himself as if he came forth himself out of Egypt…” (from Mishna, Pesaḥim 10:5).</p><p></p><p>Formation of the church year</p><p>In his earthly life, Jesus was subject to the laws of sabbath, feast, and fast prescribed in the Hebrew Bible, but his ministry and teaching pointed to a new age, the coming kingdom of God, when the Law would be fulfilled. He was, therefore, not so much concerned with outward conformity to legal regulations as he was with the spirit in which they were observed. “The sabbath was made for humankind, and not humankind for the sabbath” (Mark 2:27). It was in the context of a celebration of the Passover feast with his disciples that he was arrested, tried, and put to death.</p><p></p><p>Early Christians believed that the new age promised by Jesus had dawned with his Resurrection, on “the first day of the week” (Matthew 28:1; Mark 16:2; Luke 24:1; John 20:1). By this event the Law was fulfilled. Now every day and time were viewed as holy for the celebration and remembrance of Jesus’ triumph over sin and death. Though many of his disciples continued to observe the special times and seasons of the Jewish Law, new converts broke with the custom because they regarded it as no longer needful or necessary. St. Paul, himself a dutiful observant of the Law, considered the keeping of holy days a matter of indifference, provided the devotion be “in honor of the Lord” (Romans 14:5–9). He warned his converts not to judge one another with regard to “festivals, new moons, or sabbaths” (Colossians 2:16).</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            16. what is this poem all about? SHAMAN (for the Sukdan of Inabanga) By: Dr. Ulysses B. Aparece We both believe in this: place As either timed or timeless. A constant watchman though I am, I still dare cross the far boundaries In search of the other side of space. Gatherer of leaves, root, stones, you are The keeper of the ancient craft of touch Extending welcome to a new realm Where begins the travel of remembering. So I gain entrance to this great beyond, I must admit I carry a baggage for you To unburden, these fruits of my living. You thus begin your shaman’s journey On my body, a vast geography of frightened Muscles, bones, nerves, joints, veins. Your hands whisper the secrets of gabun, Kulavu, tanglad, kugang-kugan…. Green residences of gentle duwendes. Skill of hands untangles invisible knots In my stomach, quieting down murmurs Of the heart; yours is a sweet gurgle Of rivulets, breath of earth and forest: Mutya sa Kuampang, mutya sa Panghagban Mutya sa Matinlig, mutya sa Puwawan… Strange prayer that never really matters. The means is the message, a message, Until your crystals proclaim this portent: The world I left in one certain moment Has followed me with much vengeance, Now shakes your space from fossilized sleep. O great healer of fear—medicine man, Tambalan, oracionan, baylan, sukdan— What has happened to your knowing hands, Can’t they resist with open palms these Beastly creatures, maps of hardest structures? Where are your spirit familiars? Your canticles from the sanctuary called heart Cannot outlast the monster’s roars lording Over bleeding shrubberies, drowning Your place’s whispers, breezes sighs. How, in the end, you have become Your own province, of silence: red rivulets, Purple boundaries, capital wound. Mine, now, is the knowing touch of duty, Filling the void, wishing to connect, Sending you off, never letting go.​</h2><br />
