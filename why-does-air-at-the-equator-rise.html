                                            ACTIVITY 2: Identify as to which factor affecting climate the following statement explains.
1. The side of a mountain near water (WINDWARD SIDE) gets more rainfall, and the side away (LEEWARD) is
drier.
2. Wind patterns move heat and moisture around Earth, which can change the temperature and rainfall in a
place.
3. In Kilimanjaro, the climate gets colder the higher up you go, so at the top, it could be snowing, while at the
bottom, it is hot because of the sun’s direct rays at the equator.
4. It refers to features of the land, like mountains and hills, and valleys and low points.
5. Warm air thus moves out from land to sea, slowing down the rise of air temperature above land.
6. When an area is farther from the equator, the air temperature is lower. If it is closer to the equator, the
temperature is higher.
7. This tends to increase the temperatures of eastern coastal areas and decrease the temperatures of western
coastal areas.
8. Features like mountains cause some places to get more rainfall, and some areas to be drier.
9. Elevation refers to how high above sea level a location is.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. In the tropics, near the equator, warm air rises. ... When the air cools, it drops back to the ground, flows back towards the Equator, and warm again. The, now, warmed air rises again, and the pattern repeats. This pattern, known as convection, happens on a global scale.</p><p>2.Unable to sail and resupply due to lack of wind, crews often ran out of drinking water. To conserve scarce water, sailors on these ships would sometimes throw the horses they were transporting overboard. Thus, the phrase 'horse latitudes' was born.</p><p>3. temperate grasslands</p><p>4. In contrast to the moist windward side of a mountain, the leeward side typically has a dry, warm climate. This is because by the time air rises up the windward side and reaches the summit, it has already been stripped of the majority of its moisture.</p><p>5. This pattern, called atmospheric circulation, is caused because the Sun heats the Earth more at the equator than at the poles. It's also affected by the spin of the Earth. In the tropics, near the equator, warm air rises. ... When the air cools, it drops back to the ground, flows back towards the Equator, and warm again.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            24. 1. why do typhoons mostly form in ocean near equator? 2. what causes the upward motion of the warm air?3. what causes the formation of low pressure area?4. how does the movement of air towards the place where warm air is rising related with typhoon formation? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Tropical cyclones are like giant engines that use warm, moist air as fuel. That is why they form only over warm ocean waters near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward from near the surface. Because this air moves up and away from the surface, there is less air left near the surface. Another way to say the same thing is that the warm air rises, causing an area of lower air pressure below.</p><p></p><p>2. This vertical upward movement of air is often caused by convection. Without convection, the mean surface air temperature on our planet would be about 125 degrees, rather than the current and comfortable 59 degrees; as heat is transfer from the earth’s surface to the rest of the atmosphere by this upward movement of air.</p><p></p><p>3. A low pressure area usually begins to form as air from two regions collides and is forced upward.</p><p>The rising air creates a giant vacuum effect. Hence, a zone of low pressure is produced with the lowest pressure near the center of the storm.</p><p>As a storm approaches a particular area, the barometric pressure will lower.</p><p></p><p>4. Air that moves horizontally between high and low pressure zones makes wind. The greater the pressure difference between the pressure zones the faster the wind moves.</p><br />

                            25. ACTIVITY 2: Identify as to which factor affecting climate the following statement explains.
1. The side of a mountain near water (WINDWARD SIDE) gets more rainfall, and the side away (LEEWARD) is
drier.
2. Wind patterns move heat and moisture around Earth, which can change the temperature and rainfall in a
place.
3. In Kilimanjaro, the climate gets colder the higher up you go, so at the top, it could be snowing, while at the
bottom, it is hot because of the sun’s direct rays at the equator.
4. It refers to features of the land, like mountains and hills, and valleys and low points.
5. Warm air thus moves out from land to sea, slowing down the rise of air temperature above land.
6. When an area is farther from the equator, the air temperature is lower. If it is closer to the equator, the
temperature is higher.
7. This tends to increase the temperatures of eastern coastal areas and decrease the temperatures of western
coastal areas.
8. Features like mountains cause some places to get more rainfall, and some areas to be drier.
9. Elevation refers to how high above sea level a location is.
ASSESSMENT: Write the letter of the correct answer.
1. How does the windward side differ from the leeward side of a high land?
a. The windward receives more precipitation than the leeward.
b. The leeward side has more vegetation than the windward side.

d. The leeward side receives more precipitation than the windward side.
2. What happens to the temperature of air when altitude increases?

3. Which of the following BEST describes climate?
a. The weather that occurs in the atmosphere within a day.
b. The pattern of weather that occurs in a region over a long period of time.
c. The pattern of weather that occurs in a region over a short period of time.
d. The disturbance in the atmosphere that happens in a long period of time.
4. Why are the coldest places on earth found at the poles?
a. great amount of gaseous particles trap heat from the surface
