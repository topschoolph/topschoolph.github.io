What would our life and world be without communication?___________________________________________________________________________LESSON:DEFINITION OF COMMUNICATIONA. Etymological meaning of communicationThe English term 'Communication' has been evolved from Latin language. 'Communis and communicare' are two Latin words related to the word communication. Communis is noun word, which means common, communiality or sharing. Similarly, communicare is a verb, which means 'make something common'. Some scholars relate the term communication with an English word community. Community members have something common to each other. communities are {supposed to be} formed with the tie of communication. It is the foundation of community. Hence, where there is no communication, there can't be a community (Nepali 2011).B. Other meanings of communicationCommunication is a process of sharing and conveying messages or information from one person to another within and across channels, contexts, media, and cultures (McCornack, 2014).There is a wide variety of contexts and situations in which communication can be manifested; it can be a face-to-face interaction, a phone conversation, a group discussion, a meeting or interview, a letter correspondence, a class recitation, and many others (Sepacio and Balgos 2016).Elements of CommunicationCommunication is divided into elements which help us better understand its mechanics or process. These elements are the following:1. Speaker – the source or communicator or sender of information or message. The communicator initiates the process by having a thought or an idea that she/he wishes to transmit to others. 2. Message – the information, ideas, or thoughts conveyed by the speaker in words (whether written or spoken) or in actions (gestures or symbols) 3. Encoding – the process of converting the message into words, actions, or other forms ​</a>

</p><p>As fear spreads faster than facts, inform yourself about the virus. Deepen your knowledge and point others to trusted information. This will go a long way to debunk myths and build resilience in your community.
</p><p>
</p><p>Not sure where to start? The World Economic Forum has a continuously updated platform for information on the crisis, with insights from the World Health Organization (WHO) and its global network of experts.

</p><p>
</p><p>When you’re young and healthy, your risk of developing severe illness is lower. So consider those in your community who are most vulnerable, including older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes). Do your best to support them.

</p><p>Encourage others to take precautions, including washing your hands regularly, keeping a social distance from others and staying home when you’re sick. Basic actions like this can help limit the virus’ spread and its impact on public health, society and the economy.

Why do you think communication is important?___________________________________________________________________________3. What makes communication effective?___________________________________________________________________________4. What would our life and world be without communication?___________________________________________________________________________LESSON:DEFINITION OF COMMUNICATIONA. Etymological meaning of communicationThe English term 'Communication' has been evolved from Latin language. 'Communis and communicare' are two Latin words related to the word communication. Communis is noun word, which means common, communiality or sharing. Similarly, communicare is a verb, which means 'make something common'. Some scholars relate the term communication with an English word community. Community members have something common to each other. communities are {supposed to be} formed with the tie of communication. It is the foundation of community. Hence, where there is no communication, there can't be a community (Nepali 2011).B. Other meanings of communicationCommunication is a process of sharing and conveying messages or information from one person to another within and across channels, contexts, media, and cultures (McCornack, 2014).There is a wide variety of contexts and situations in which communication can be manifested; it can be a face-to-face interaction, a phone conversation, a group discussion, a meeting or interview, a letter correspondence, a class recitation, and many others (Sepacio and Balgos 2016).Elements of CommunicationCommunication is divided into elements which help us better understand its mechanics or process. These elements are the following:1. Speaker – the source or communicator or sender of information or message. The communicator initiates the process by having a thought or an idea that she/he wishes to transmit to others. 2. Message – the information, ideas, or thoughts conveyed by the speaker in words (whether written or spoken) or in actions (gestures or symbols) 3. Encoding – the process of converting the message into words, actions, or other forms ​</h2><br />

Ngunit habang tumatagal, naiintindihan ko na ang aginaldo ay hindi lamang isang paraan upang magbigay ng pera sa amin, kundi ito ay isang simbolo ng pagpapahalaga at pag-aalaga ng aming ama sa aming pamilya.</p><p></p><p>Sa panahon ng pandemya, hindi na namin nagawang magtipon sa bahay para sa pagbibigay ng aginaldo.

This may sound simple, but communication is actually a very complex subject.                                                        </strong></p><p><strong>
The transmission of the message from sender to recipient can be affected by a huge range of things. These include our emotions, the cultural situation, the medium used to communicate, and even our location. The complexity is why good communication skills are considered so desirable by employers around the world: accurate, effective and unambiguous communication is actually extremely hard.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>im sorry if this is wrong, but atleast u could take a hint, im really sorry if this is wrong</strong></p><p><strong>the link: https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/what-is-communication.html</strong></p><p><strong>
