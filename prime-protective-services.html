                                            Exercise 3: Identifying the Ultimate Theme Directions: Below is another debate speech which talks of a certain topic or theme Identify the ultimate theme and write it on the space provided Mother Theresa once said, and I quote. "I only feel angry when I see waste, when I see people throwing away things we could use," unquote Friends, Ladies and gentlemen, good day Lawmakers are now pushing for the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience and we, in the affirmative side firmiy regret its creation For this constructive speech. I will be discussing two arguments why it is not necessary to create the Department of Disaster Resilience under the provisions of House Bill No. 5989 which has already passed the third and final reading in the House of Representatives For my first argument, the proposed creation of DDR fails to justify how it is different from existing institutions that already deal and are effective with disaster relief and response. Vice President Leni Robredo in fact convincingly stated that the government should look into the gaps in exisung agencies instead of creating new ones that will create unnecessary layer in the bureaucracy when in fact existing state agencies are already performing its mandate Furthermore, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman reiterates that the Omice of the Civil Defense, Social Welfare Developmeni, Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), and the Department of Public works and Highways (DPWH) among others are actively performing on disaster prevention, mitigation, management and rehabilitation Meanwhile, RA 10121, also known as the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 provides that the (NDRRMC) is the working group convened during times of crises to ensure the protection and welfare of all Filipinos during disasters or emergencies. Included in its functions are securing communication lines during calamities, issuing warning signals, providing emergency transportation, and facilitating evacuation and rescue missions. It also leads in the provision of engineering, health and rehabilitation, public education and auxiliary services such as fire-fighung and post-calamily measures. This is yet to take into account the contribution of non-government organizations such as the Red Cross and various charities. And these ladies and gentlemen are mere duplications under the proposed creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience. We have to remember that to create a Department of Disaster Resilience, there's an expectation that it will hold all these responsibilities and not cause blatant redundancy in the government's functions. PRACTICE HYGIENE PROTOCOLS AT ALL TIMES 6 For my second argument, most countries have separate departments for disaster resilience and response, yet they are still successful, efficient, and effective. In Japan, Thailand, and Singapore, an ad hoc committee is created headed by the prime minister, as needed, in response to particular calamities. In fact, in a study titled, Institutional Issues on Disaster Risk Reduction and Management conducted by Sonny Domingo, the Interational Best Practices and Institutional Platforms was presented and such mentioned that the Southeast Asian countries present good cases of DRRM institutional setups thar address similar regional disaster hazards. Underscored in this study is that, the Malaysian government's disaster response is one of the most functional and effecuve and such design is modeled from those of the Philippines and Indonesia. Considering such result, I am wondering why there is such move to create a Department of Disaster Resilience when in reality, the status quo, the design we are using in disaster response is laudable and is recognized interationally? It is our contention therefore in the affirmative side that our resiliency initiatives have been gaining support in all levels of poliucal subdivisions of the government, including communities and outside stakeholders. And when such current momentum is sustained, the coming years would be witness to the monumental transformation of the institutional landscape for DRRM in the country. Hence, we regret the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience in the Philippines.​</a>

Governments say they want to protect children from the COVID-19 coronavirus. Schools in Japan will remain closed until April the 8th, which is the start of the new school year. Children in Hong Kong will return to school on April the 20th at the earliest. Parents are now worried about the school closures. Working parents have to think about how to care for younger children. Grandparents will look after many children while their parents go to work. However, many children have no grandparents or extended family who live nearby. Parents may have to pay for expensive childcare fees. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe shut the country's schools after a meeting of Japan's anti-virus task force. He said the next two weeks are critical to control the spread of COVID-19. He wants to "stem the risk of many children and teachers becoming infected through gathering for long hours every day". The government said it would urge public services and private companies to make it easier for people to take time off work to look after their children. An angry mother said: "I wonder if the government thinks it is OK to leave children at home alone for long hours." She asked: "What's the point of closing schools if parents are still commuting in packed trains in which passengers may have COVID-19?" ​</a>

                            6. Exercise 3: Identifying the Ultimate Theme Directions: Below is another debate speech which talks of a certain topic or theme Identify the ultimate theme and write it on the space provided Mother Theresa once said, and I quote. "I only feel angry when I see waste, when I see people throwing away things we could use," unquote Friends, Ladies and gentlemen, good day Lawmakers are now pushing for the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience and we, in the affirmative side firmiy regret its creation For this constructive speech. I will be discussing two arguments why it is not necessary to create the Department of Disaster Resilience under the provisions of House Bill No. 5989 which has already passed the third and final reading in the House of Representatives For my first argument, the proposed creation of DDR fails to justify how it is different from existing institutions that already deal and are effective with disaster relief and response. Vice President Leni Robredo in fact convincingly stated that the government should look into the gaps in exisung agencies instead of creating new ones that will create unnecessary layer in the bureaucracy when in fact existing state agencies are already performing its mandate Furthermore, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman reiterates that the Omice of the Civil Defense, Social Welfare Developmeni, Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), and the Department of Public works and Highways (DPWH) among others are actively performing on disaster prevention, mitigation, management and rehabilitation Meanwhile, RA 10121, also known as the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 provides that the (NDRRMC) is the working group convened during times of crises to ensure the protection and welfare of all Filipinos during disasters or emergencies. Included in its functions are securing communication lines during calamities, issuing warning signals, providing emergency transportation, and facilitating evacuation and rescue missions. It also leads in the provision of engineering, health and rehabilitation, public education and auxiliary services such as fire-fighung and post-calamily measures. This is yet to take into account the contribution of non-government organizations such as the Red Cross and various charities. And these ladies and gentlemen are mere duplications under the proposed creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience. We have to remember that to create a Department of Disaster Resilience, there's an expectation that it will hold all these responsibilities and not cause blatant redundancy in the government's functions. PRACTICE HYGIENE PROTOCOLS AT ALL TIMES 6 For my second argument, most countries have separate departments for disaster resilience and response, yet they are still successful, efficient, and effective. In Japan, Thailand, and Singapore, an ad hoc committee is created headed by the prime minister, as needed, in response to particular calamities. In fact, in a study titled, Institutional Issues on Disaster Risk Reduction and Management conducted by Sonny Domingo, the Interational Best Practices and Institutional Platforms was presented and such mentioned that the Southeast Asian countries present good cases of DRRM institutional setups thar address similar regional disaster hazards. Underscored in this study is that, the Malaysian government's disaster response is one of the most functional and effecuve and such design is modeled from those of the Philippines and Indonesia. Considering such result, I am wondering why there is such move to create a Department of Disaster Resilience when in reality, the status quo, the design we are using in disaster response is laudable and is recognized interationally? It is our contention therefore in the affirmative side that our resiliency initiatives have been gaining support in all levels of poliucal subdivisions of the government, including communities and outside stakeholders. And when such current momentum is sustained, the coming years would be witness to the monumental transformation of the institutional landscape for DRRM in the country. Hence, we regret the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience in the Philippines.​</h2><br />

What is the topic of the listening text?</strong></p><p></p>The topic indicated above <strong>exhibits the viewpoint of the Government in Japan and Hong Kong towards their finding decisions </strong>on how to keep their citizens, specifically the children safe during this time of the pandemic. The text also <strong>implies viewpoints of those parents</strong> realizing that having their children at home for protection will give them a reason to not preserve their children as for the reason that they'll be coming on work.<p></p><p><strong>2. What is the important idea </strong><strong>being presented in the text?</strong></p><p></p>At understanding the text, for me, <strong>one of the important ideas was the paradoxes between the two beliefs of </strong><strong>sides</strong> that is the government and parents who want the best for the kids in their nation.<p></p><p></p><p><strong>3. How is the idea being presented? Explicitly (clearly) or implied (hidden)</strong></p><p></p><p></p>For me, <strong>the idea quite belonged in the implied or the hidden.</strong> Honestly, the thoughts of the two sides that contradict <strong>haven't yet narrated their whole impressions regarding their sides.</strong> There are way many unspoken thoughts, which made the listeners of this text be frightened with the more applicable judgment.<p></p><p><strong>4. What helped you determine the worthy ideas presented?</strong></p><p></p><strong>Their compassion for the children in their nations is what helped me determine each idea presented.</strong> Even if it states contradiction, both aspects want insurance for the youths and they want the best for them.<p></p><p></p><p><strong>5. Is the idea presented worth keeping and worth sharing with others? Why?</strong></p><p></p><strong>For me, yes.</strong> Those ideas were a bit confusing but it administers best for the youths and it is worth sharing with others because they can be an inspirational thing for them and they could be motivated somehow.<p></p><p>#BrainlyChallenge2021</p><p></p><br />
