                        Artists put themselves into their artwork. They express who they are, what they feel, what are their thoughts, their personalities, their views about their surroundings, in the form of art they are making. They make their artworks their world, and that's what makes an artwork unique.SUGGESTED ART MATERIALS Powder paint, long handled brushes, clay, chalk, large crayons, large pieces of paper, cardboard, oak tag wrap- ping paper, wooden boxes, orange crates, wall paper, and textiles may be used for constructive handwork and pro- jects such as commuities, houses, toys, farms, or buildings.Materials are what things are made from. Materials have different qualities: they can be smooth or rough; hard or soft; heavy or light; fragile or indestructible. Artists choose materials because of their particular qualites. The same material can be used in very different ways to achieve very different results.Artists often use a particular medium because it affects the texture or color of the work of art. Other times, the artist will choose a medium because it helps the audience interpret the art in a specific way.The stuff that artists use when they make a work of art influences both form and content. Every material brings something special to the creative process and the finished work. Materials influence how artists make their work and how viewers perceive it.<p></p><p>Hope it helps pa brainlist po</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Paul Jackson Pollock</p><p>2. The term Color Field Painting was coined by the American art critic Clement Greenberg , whose favorite Jules Olitski belonged. The inspiration for the dramatic use of color in Color Field painting came from the work of the Abstract Expressionists Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman.Action painting got its name from an essay written by American art critic Harold Rosenberg in 1952. It claimed they had thrown out the known standards of art and were creating expressions of their individuality without being tied down by traditional processes.</p><p>3. Pop art is a movement that emerged in the mid-to-late-1950's in Britain and America. Commonly associated with artists such as Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Jasper Jones, pop art draws its inspiration from popular and commercial culture such as advertising, pop music, movies and the media.</p><p>4. The best art movement is the movement of the Romans throughout the Decades, because it was unique among the powers of the ancient world in developing only a limited artistic language of its own. Roman architecture and engineering was never less than bold, but its painting and sculpture was based on Greek traditions and also on art forms developed in its vassal states like Egypt and Ancient Persia.</p><p>5. The dominant element of art used was lines, geometric shapes and complimentary colors. Research popular Op Artists Bridget Riley and Victor Vasarely. Create an Op Art painting or drawing that clearly creates an optical illusion of movement or shifting perspective using lines and complimentary color or black and white.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
