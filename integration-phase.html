On Good Manners, Right Conduct, and Values EducationPresident duterte signed a bill in to law that restores subjects like good manners, right conduct, and values education. Proponents of Republic Act 11476 hope that the new law is implementing rules and regulations will be realesed in time for the upcoming school year so that the subjects can be included in the curriculum. The law is passed at a time when the country is fighting a fatal pandemic. In response to the public health crisis the issues raised is RA 11476 need to be considered. The measure, according to Pasig Rep. Roman Romulo, who chairs the House committee on basic education and culture, will help instill basic tenets in the youth such as "caring for oneself, giving concern for others, according to proper respect for people, uphold discipline and oerder, cultivate sincerity, honesty, obedience and, above all, country love." In 2013,Good Manners and Right Conduct subjects were phased out and replace with Edukasyon sa Pagpapakatao. GMRC will be integrated into daily activities in kindergarden and taught as a seperate subject in Grade 1-6 under the new law. Frome Grade 7-10, GMRC will be integrated into the Values Education subject. For Grade 11 and 12, Values Education will be integrated intoall subjects. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is best contained by the country's adopted slogan:healing as one. It necessitates being mindful of one's health and the health of others - we stay healthy so that we do not infect others, particularly the elderly and those with comorbidities, for  whom COVID-19 infection could be fatal. GMRC and Values Education can help promote the behaviors and attitudes necessary for success in the fight against COVID-19. Public officials from the President down should lead by example and show manners, in both word and deed. Aside from the pandemic, practically every aspect of life can benefit from good manners, proper conduct, and proper values. It is past time to give the subjects the attention the deserve.

                                            I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M.

On Good Manners, Right Conduct, and Values EducationPresident duterte signed a bill in to law that restores subjects like good manners, right conduct, and values education. Proponents of Republic Act 11476 hope that the new law is implementing rules and regulations will be realesed in time for the upcoming school year so that the subjects can be included in the curriculum. The law is passed at a time when the country is fighting a fatal pandemic. In response to the public health crisis the issues raised is RA 11476 need to be considered. The measure, according to Pasig Rep. Roman Romulo, who chairs the House committee on basic education and culture, will help instill basic tenets in the youth such as "caring for oneself, giving concern for others, according to proper respect for people, uphold discipline and oerder, cultivate sincerity, honesty, obedience and, above all, country love." In 2013,Good Manners and Right Conduct subjects were phased out and replace with Edukasyon sa Pagpapakatao. GMRC will be integrated into daily activities in kindergarden and taught as a seperate subject in Grade 1-6 under the new law. Frome Grade 7-10, GMRC will be integrated into the Values Education subject. For Grade 11 and 12, Values Education will be integrated intoall subjects. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is best contained by the country's adopted slogan:healing as one. It necessitates being mindful of one's health and the health of others - we stay healthy so that we do not infect others, particularly the elderly and those with comorbidities, for  whom COVID-19 infection could be fatal. GMRC and Values Education can help promote the behaviors and attitudes necessary for success in the fight against COVID-19. Public officials from the President down should lead by example and show manners, in both word and deed. Aside from the pandemic, practically every aspect of life can benefit from good manners, proper conduct, and proper values. It is past time to give the subjects the attention the deserve.

<p>The article tackles about a newly signed law that will be integrated into the educational system. The law teaches students and the youth in general  to have GMRC or Good Manners and Right Conduct.  This is also in relation to the rampaging worldwide pandemic. It gravitates towards being mindful of one’s health especially of mental health. Because a lot of people are stressed, they tend to be rude and forget their values, manners (especially following health protocols, and right attitude.

                            19. I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M. S. (2010, April 17). 7 Ways to increase teacher technology integration in the classroom.

Nonfunctional requirements are technical in nature. A requirement that states that a response must be returned to the consumer within two seconds is an example of a nonfunctional requirement.
