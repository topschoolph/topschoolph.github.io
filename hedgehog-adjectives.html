                                            Read the short story. Then answer each question. A Pool Fit for a Hedgehog Summer was here, and it was a hot one! Cora the hedgehog was out foraging for food, trying to stay cool. She saw her friend Heather by her den. Heather was splashing around in her little pool outside. "Hi Heather!" Cora called. "When did you get a pool?" "Hi Cora! I just got it yesterday, it's really helping cool me down. Would you like to join me?" Heather replied. "I would love to thanks!" They talked for a long while, and Cora had a lot of questions for Heather about the pool. She asked who Heather bought it from, if it was expensive, and if Heather thought she was going to use it a lot this summer. "I saw a commercial for the pool company, and the commercial got me thinking about how nice a pool would be. I looked at reviews to see if other people liked their pools, and if the company did a good job. When I saw that the company did a good job, and that their price was similar to other companies, I decided to buy one! I would definitely recommend them to you. I think I'm going to love having a pool on hot days like this one!" Heather told Cora Cora thanked Heather for letting her cool off, and continued to look for food. As she was looking for food and munching on delicious insects, she could not stop thinking about the pool. It did get awfully hot in the summertime, and water was hard to come by on the hot days. She decided to do some research of her own before making a decision. She looked up hedgehog-sized pools, and the company Heather talked about was the first listing. She read the prices and the reviews other hedgehogs left about the company and the pools. It looked like they did a great job, and she even watched a video of the commercial Heather had seen! Then Cora looked up other companies. They all looked similar, but since Heather had a good experience with this company, Cora decided to go with the same one. A week later, Cora was happily splashing in her own pool! Heather walked by, and Cora thanked her for the recommendation. It was one of the best summers yet! 1. Retell the story in your own words. 2. Describe Cora's character. What evidence from the text helps you describe her? 3. What influenced Cora to use the same company as Heather for her pool? 4. Where do you think the setting of the story might be? What evidence makes you think that? 5. Have you ever been influenced by a commercial or by your friends to get something? What was it?​</a>

                                            Read the short story. Then answer each question.     A Pool Fit for a Hedgehog Summer was here, and it was a hot one! Cora the hedgehog was out foraging for food, trying to stay cool. She saw her friend Heather by her den. Heather was splashing around in her little pool outside. "Hi Heather!" Cora called. "When did you get a pool?" "Hi Cora! I just got it yesterday, it's really helping cool me down. Would you like to join me?" Heather replied. "I would love to thanks!" They talked for a long while, and Cora had a lot of questions for Heather about the pool. She asked who Heather bought it from, if it was expensive, and if Heather thought she was going to use it a lot this summer. "I saw a commercial for the pool company, and the commercial got me thinking about how nice a pool would be. I looked at reviews to see if other people liked their pools, and if the company did a good job. When I saw that the company did a good job, and that their price was similar to other companies, I decided to buy one! I would definitely recommend them to you. I think I'm going to love having a pool on hot days like this one!" Heather told Cora Cora thanked Heather for letting her cool off, and continued to look for food. As she was looking for food and munching on delicious insects, she could not stop thinking about the pool. It did get awfully hot in the summertime, and water was hard to come by on the hot days. She decided to do some research of her own before making a decision. She looked up hedgehog-sized pools, and the company Heather talked about was the first listing. She read the prices and the reviews other hedgehogs left about the company and the pools. It looked like they did a great job, and she even watched a video of the commercial Heather had seen! Then Cora looked up other companies. They all looked similar, but since Heather had a good experience with this company, Cora decided to go with the same one. A week later, Cora was happily splashing in her own pool! Heather walked by, and Cora thanked her for the recommendation. It was one of the best summers yet! 1. Retell the story in your own words. 2. Describe Cora's character. What evidence from the text helps you describe her?3. What influenced Cora to use the same company as Heather for her pool? 4. Where do you think the setting of the story might be? What evidence makes you think that? 5. Have you ever been influenced by a commercial or by your friends to get something? What was it?​</a>

                            6. Read the short story. Then answer each question. A Pool Fit for a Hedgehog Summer was here, and it was a hot one! Cora the hedgehog was out foraging for food, trying to stay cool. She saw her friend Heather by her den. Heather was splashing around in her little pool outside. "Hi Heather!" Cora called. "When did you get a pool?" "Hi Cora! I just got it yesterday, it's really helping cool me down. Would you like to join me?" Heather replied. "I would love to thanks!" They talked for a long while, and Cora had a lot of questions for Heather about the pool. She asked who Heather bought it from, if it was expensive, and if Heather thought she was going to use it a lot this summer. "I saw a commercial for the pool company, and the commercial got me thinking about how nice a pool would be. I looked at reviews to see if other people liked their pools, and if the company did a good job. When I saw that the company did a good job, and that their price was similar to other companies, I decided to buy one! I would definitely recommend them to you. I think I'm going to love having a pool on hot days like this one!" Heather told Cora Cora thanked Heather for letting her cool off, and continued to look for food. As she was looking for food and munching on delicious insects, she could not stop thinking about the pool. It did get awfully hot in the summertime, and water was hard to come by on the hot days. She decided to do some research of her own before making a decision. She looked up hedgehog-sized pools, and the company Heather talked about was the first listing. She read the prices and the reviews other hedgehogs left about the company and the pools. It looked like they did a great job, and she even watched a video of the commercial Heather had seen! Then Cora looked up other companies. They all looked similar, but since Heather had a good experience with this company, Cora decided to go with the same one. A week later, Cora was happily splashing in her own pool! Heather walked by, and Cora thanked her for the recommendation. It was one of the best summers yet! 1. Retell the story in your own words. 2. Describe Cora's character. What evidence from the text helps you describe her? 3. What influenced Cora to use the same company as Heather for her pool? 4. Where do you think the setting of the story might be? What evidence makes you think that? 5. Have you ever been influenced by a commercial or by your friends to get something? What was it?​</h2><br />

                            26. Read the short story. Then answer each question.     A Pool Fit for a Hedgehog Summer was here, and it was a hot one! Cora the hedgehog was out foraging for food, trying to stay cool. She saw her friend Heather by her den. Heather was splashing around in her little pool outside. "Hi Heather!" Cora called. "When did you get a pool?" "Hi Cora! I just got it yesterday, it's really helping cool me down. Would you like to join me?" Heather replied. "I would love to thanks!" They talked for a long while, and Cora had a lot of questions for Heather about the pool. She asked who Heather bought it from, if it was expensive, and if Heather thought she was going to use it a lot this summer. "I saw a commercial for the pool company, and the commercial got me thinking about how nice a pool would be. I looked at reviews to see if other people liked their pools, and if the company did a good job. When I saw that the company did a good job, and that their price was similar to other companies, I decided to buy one! I would definitely recommend them to you. I think I'm going to love having a pool on hot days like this one!" Heather told Cora Cora thanked Heather for letting her cool off, and continued to look for food. As she was looking for food and munching on delicious insects, she could not stop thinking about the pool. It did get awfully hot in the summertime, and water was hard to come by on the hot days. She decided to do some research of her own before making a decision. She looked up hedgehog-sized pools, and the company Heather talked about was the first listing. She read the prices and the reviews other hedgehogs left about the company and the pools. It looked like they did a great job, and she even watched a video of the commercial Heather had seen! Then Cora looked up other companies. They all looked similar, but since Heather had a good experience with this company, Cora decided to go with the same one. A week later, Cora was happily splashing in her own pool! Heather walked by, and Cora thanked her for the recommendation. It was one of the best summers yet! 1. Retell the story in your own words. 2. Describe Cora's character. What evidence from the text helps you describe her?3. What influenced Cora to use the same company as Heather for her pool? 4. Where do you think the setting of the story might be? What evidence makes you think that? 5. Have you ever been influenced by a commercial or by your friends to get something? What was it?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>2. Describe Cora’s character. What evidence from the text helps 
</p><p>you describe her?
</p><p>Cora is careful and well organized. She talked to her friend 
</p><p>about how she decided on the pool she purchased. Cora then 
</p><p>did her own research before going ahead with her own 
</p><p>purchase.
</p><p>3. What influenced Cora to use the same company as Heather for 
</p><p>her pool?
</p><p>Heather’s recommendation influenced Cora to use the same 
</p><p>company for her pool.
</p><p>4. Where do you think the setting of the story might be? What 
</p><p>evidence makes you think that?
</p><p>The setting is in a forest, as evidenced by the Cora foraging for 
</p><p>food at the beginning of the story.
