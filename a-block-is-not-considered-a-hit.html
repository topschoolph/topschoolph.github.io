                    <p>Bella had an experiment to find out which object will hit the floor first. She used 45 kg and 15 kg of blocks. Which of the following could be the result of her experiment if air resistance is NOT PRESENT or NOT CONSIDERED?
A. Both objects will hit the floor at the same time. 
B. The heavier one will hit the floor first because friction is greater on objects with greater mass.
C. The heavier one will hit the floor first because gravity is greater on objects with greater mass.
D. The lighter one will hit the floor first since it’s easy for gravity to pull the object downward.</p>

(Ablock is not considered a hit.)● Ball may be played off the net during a volley and ona serve.● A ball hitting a boundary line is in.● A ball is out if it hits an antennae, the floorcompletely outside the court, any of the net or cablesoutside the antennae, the referee stand or pole, theceiling above a non-playable area.● It is legal to contact the ball with any part of aplayer’s body.● It is illegal to catch, hold or throw the ball.● A player cannot block or attack a serve from on orinside the 10-foot line.● After the serve, front-line players may switchpositions at the net.● Matches are made up of sets; the number dependson level of play. 3-set matches are 2 sets to 25points and a third set to 15.

                            1. Bella had an experiment to find out which object will hit the floor first. She used 45 kg and 15 kg of blocks. Which of the following could be the result of her experiment if air resistance is NOT PRESENT or NOT CONSIDERED?
A. Both objects will hit the floor at the same time. 
B. The heavier one will hit the floor first because friction is greater on objects with greater mass.
C. The heavier one will hit the floor first because gravity is greater on objects with greater mass.
D. The lighter one will hit the floor first since it’s easy for gravity to pull the object downward.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The correct answer is C. The heavier one will hit the floor first because gravity is greater on objects with greater mass, assuming air resistance is not present or not considered. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This is due to the fact that the gravitational force that pulls the objects toward the ground is proportional to their mass. The greater the mass of an object, the greater the force of gravity acting on it. Therefore, the 45 kg block will experience a greater force of gravity than the 15 kg block and will hit the floor first.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. B.</p><p>2.Valency: Metals have 1 to 3 electrons in the outermost shell of their atoms. Conduction: Metals are good conductors because they have free electrons. Silver and copper are the two best conductors of heat and electricity.</p><p>3.The lower the level of resistivity, the more electrical conductivity a metal has. Copper has low resistivity, and therefore is an excellent conductor. Copper is also less oxidative than other metals.</p><p>4.Usually good current carrying conductors should have following properties: Low resistivity/ / high conductivity. Low temperature coefficient of resistivity. ... Good electrical conductors are also good heat conductors because both forms of energy rely on free electrons to transfer through the material.</p><p>5.D.</p><p>6.Adding dense material to treatment helps stop sound waves from exiting a source wall, ceiling or floor. Materials include mass-loaded vinyl, drywall, soundproof sheetrock, plywood, fibreboard, concrete or rubber. Different widths and densities in soundproofing material reduces sound within a variable frequency range.</p><p>7.Some examples of translucent objects are ground glass (also called frosted glass), butter paper, etc. So, among the following options wood, stone and plastic are opaque objects, only ground glass is translucent.</p><p>8.Black objects do not absorb more light or energy necessarily. Rather, objects that absorb more light/energy appear to be black, due to the absorption of said light.
</p><p>
</p><p>Thus it is the elemental material make-up which determines color based on what wavelengths of energy it absorbs or reflects.
</p><p>
</p><p>Colors themselves are not absorbent or reflective, and have no more material presence/interaction than the photons which display them.
</p><p>
</p><p>To find out why an object absorbs or or reflects more light, you must first define the object in question, and then seek out its chemical make-up, and then determine why the atomic components do so.
</p><p>
</p><p>My speculation is: You can't fill a full glass or it spills over. But you can fill a glass that it not full.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, I would not conclude it to be so simple.
</p><p>
</p><p>The following is comment I shared on another’s comment, but I hope it will help to clarify a few things for you, so I will share it here.
</p><p>
</p><p>I agree with most of your comment, but I would like to point out that black is not exactly the absence of color or light.
</p><p>
</p><p>Whether you do subtractive or additive color mixing, all the colors mixed together make white. This is most evident in additive color mixing (the mixing of colored lights), which adds all the colors to create white light. However, in subtractive color mixing (or mixing colored matter), as observed when mixing paint, the colors mix to create black.
</p><p>
</p><p>As you stated above, when dealing with colored matter, the color you are observing is actually the only color that is not absorbed, and thus is instead reflected. In black materials, all wavelengths of light are absorbed.
</p><p>
</p><p>Clearly, we just stated all colors of light mixed together makes white. So if all colors are absorbed, the black object is actually white.
</p><p>
</p><p>Since no one material or composition of materials is a perfect absorber, there actually is light reflecting off the black material, and it is reflecting all wavelengths to some degree.
</p><p>
</p><p>The conjuration of black/blackness is a result only of contrast against an otherwise “more white” background or exterior setting.
</p><p>
</p><p>To observe this, we must return to additive color mixing, the mixing of colored lights. It is probably easiest done with a projector, such as a movie or school projector. Take your translucent projection film and draw a black circle in the center to see the black circle projected onto the screen.
</p><p>
</p><p>If light is white in essence, how does the color black get projected onto a white screen?
</p><p>
</p><p>You put your hand in front of the spot on the screen where the black circle is projected, and the light on your hands is white.
</p><p>
</p><p>The secret therein can only be found when looking into the projector. From afar, you will see a broad, bright white light projection. And when you step closer to the projector, you will notice a second, smaller, dimmer white light projection which is responsible for for displaying the black on the screen.
</p><p>
</p><p>Conclusion: Black is a lesser magnitude of white, which is only observed when contrasted against a greater magnitude of white. In case you find yourself surrounded by a lesser magnitude of white, what would normally appear black against a greater magnitude of white, would appear white now against the lesser magnitude of the environment.
</p><p>
</p><p>A cheap flashlight centered in front of a spotlight would offer the same contrast, as would a small spotlight centered before a large dim light. I highly recommend researching demonstrations of this publicly available, if you are interested.
