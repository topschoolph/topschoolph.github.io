Slow change in a species over time descnbes Darwin's theory of (evolution or natural selection).3. According to Darwin, evolution occurs as a result of (natural selection or artificial selection)4. The (individual or population) evolves5 Giant tortoises are only found on the Galapagos Islands. Each island had a different species of tortoise. This would suggest that all  tortoise involved from(a  common ancestors or different ancestors).6 The source of variation in a species is (mutations or lack of change) in DNA7. Mutations can be harmful or helpful. A helpful mutation will (increase or decrease) the fitness of an individual in its environment.8. According to the theory of natural selection, a good mutation will probably (increase or decrease)in frequency in a population9 Members of (different or the same) species share the same group of alleles called a (gene pool orgene frequency).10. Fossils in the lowest sedimentary rock layers are (older or younger) than fossils found in higherlayers of rock11 The whale's flipper and the arms of a human are examples of (vestigial organs or homologousstructures) because they have the same bones but use them for different functions.12. The hip bones in whales and snakes serve no function, so they are examples of (vestigial organsor homologous structures).​</a>

Speciation is the evolutionary process by which populations evolve to become distinct species4. Changes in temperature resulting from global warming, for example, may cause a species tochange its geographical distribution northward5. A species is a group of organisms that share a genetic heritage, are able to interbreed, and tocreate offspring.6. The scientific name of a species is composed of three Latin words.7. Insects and spiders belong to phylum Arthropoda.8. You can breed organisms which belong the same phylum.9. Species means "birth", descent, "origin", "sort", or "type."10. The hierarchical system of taxonomy from largest to smallest are domain, kingdom, phylum,family, class, order, genus, and species.​</a>

This would suggest that all  tortoise involved from(a  common ancestors or different ancestors).6 The source of variation in a species is (mutations or lack of change) in DNA7. Mutations can be harmful or helpful. A helpful mutation will (increase or decrease) the fitness of an individual in its environment.8.

A concept paper provides an overview of the project, helps funding agencies eliminate proposals that are likely to be disapproved. 2. One purpose of a concept paper is to obtain informal feedback on the ideas prior to preparing the full proposal. 3. A concept paper usually ranges from 500-2000 sentences and is divided into several parts. 4. Explication is used for abstract concept that needs to be linked to real variations. 5. In writing a concept paper, you need to use more than five pages to explain excluding the cover page. 6. Always cite your references in your concept paper. 7. The three ways in explaining a concept are definition, extended, and clarification. 8. The budget, methodology, and timeline should be clearly aligned in your paper. 9.

Variation is any similarity between cells, individual organisms, or groups of organisms of anyspecies.3. Speciation is the evolutionary process by which populations evolve to become distinct species4. Changes in temperature resulting from global warming, for example, may cause a species tochange its geographical distribution northward5. A species is a group of organisms that share a genetic heritage, are able to interbreed, and tocreate offspring.6. The scientific name of a species is composed of three Latin words.7. Insects and spiders belong to phylum Arthropoda.8. You can breed organisms which belong the same phylum.9. Species means "birth", descent, "origin", "sort", or "type."10. The hierarchical system of taxonomy from largest to smallest are domain, kingdom, phylum,family, class, order, genus, and species.​</h2><br />

C</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>1. <strong>Homeostasis</strong> - Derived from the Greek words same and steady. Refers to the internal balance of cells or a process done by biotic factors to maintain a stable conditions with abiotic factors necessary for survival.</p><p>2. <strong>Organ </strong>- A collective term for tissues that works together for the overall function of the organ.</p><p>3.<strong> Unicellular </strong>- Uni means one. Hence, an organism that is made with only cell is called unicellular organism, or single-celled organism.</p><p>4. <strong>Change in species over time </strong>- Evolution is the change of genetic make-up of any species over time. It is due to the changes of the environment they're living in, they will adapt in changes, thus changing their structures and genetics. Evolution by natural selection.</p><p>5. <strong>Natural Selection </strong>- The theory of natural selection refers to the process of surviving and reproducing through adapting to the environment.<strong> </strong></p><p>6. in the <strong>Sun </strong>- The sun provides energy to the plants that produces glucose or sugar that humans and animals need. Sunlight is also required by humans and animals for the Vitamin D.</p><p>7. <strong>Natural Selection </strong>- Can be synonymous to genetic drift. These two are the driving forces of evolution, the only difference of the two is that, genetic drift is done by chance.</p><p>8. <strong>As-e-x-u-a-l </strong>- An a-s-e-x-u-a-l reproduction does not require a partner to reproduce.
