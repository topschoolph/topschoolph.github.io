I have learned many facts about owls. First, most owls are nocturnal which means they hunt at night. Next, owls can not move their eyes in the socket so they must turn their entire head. Finally, the smallest owl is the Elf Owl which is six inches long and has wingspan of 15 inches. Owls are very interesting birds.

                                            Directions: Read the passage. Then, answer the questions.             The Snowy Owl Among North American birds, the snowy owl ranks first in size. It can reach 27 inches in length and have a wingspan of 5 feet. The snowy owl is light for its size- about four pounds. It is easily distinguished from other large owls within its habitat by its predominately white plumage. The adult has few natural enemies, but eggs and juveniles are in danger from Arctic foxes and husky dogs. Owls depend on their keen sense of hearing and the efficiency of their sight, which is designed to work well in the dark. Unlike most other owls that primarily hunt at night, the snowy owl is diurnal, making it well- suited to survive in the far north where it can be continuously light or dark around the clock. These owls mainly feed on lemmings, voles, and rabbits but are known to eat other birds and fish as well. The snowy owl can fly long distances carrying an animal weighing far more than itself. 1. Where is the snowy owl's habitat? How can you tell?_ 2. What color plumage do other owls of the region have? How can you tell? 3. Does the snowy owl hunt during the day, at night, or both? What word tells you? 4. Is the snowy owl a carnivore or herbivore? How can you tell? 5. Could the snowy owl carry off a rabbit weighing five pounds? How do you know? ​</a>

                                            " THE OWL AND THE WOODPECKER"Once upon a time, in a a forest far away, there lived a woodpecker. The woodpecker lived in a tree in which he slept all night and worked all day.In the tree next door, there came to live an owl who liked to work all night and slept all day.The woodpecker worked so hard and made so much noise that his tapping woke the owl. You see, a woodpecker pecks at the wood and makes a continuous tapping sound."I say, you there!" screeched the owl. "How can I possibly sleep with all that noise going on?""This is my three," the woodpecker said, "and I shall tap it as I please."The owl lost his temper. His screeches and hoots echoed through the forest and animals for miles came running to see what was the matter."You carry on tapping, Master Woodpecker," squeked the mouse. "Owl is always bossing and chasing us about,""Oh, do be quiet," growled the bear, "Woodpecker, stop tapping and let Owl sleep. We like a peaceful life around here."Angrily, the owl swooped down on the small animals who ran for their lives and hid in all kinds of curious places. "Bully," they shouted when they were very safe.Then the owl ask the bigger animals what he could do to stop the noise but they all shook their heads. "How should we know?" they said. "You are the wise and clever one. Perhaps you could move to another tree.""Why should I?" snapped the owl. "I like living in this tree. That noisy woodpecker must move."But the woodpecker would not move. Day after day, his noisy tapping kept the owl awake. And day after the day the became more and more bad-tempered. He began to be so crotchety and rude that all the other animals decided that something must be done.So they held a meeting."Something must be dome," said the badger."Woodpecker was here first, so owl must leave.""But he says he will not leave his tree," replied the Deer"In that case we shall have to push down the tree, and then he will have to leave," said the crafty Fox.That night, while the owl was out hunting they all tried to push down tree. But no matter how hard they pushed and pulled and panted they could not move the tree the smallest bit. So they gave up and went back home.Some time later, two strangers came to the forest. They were a pair of beavers, and the took fancy to the owl's tree, and started to gnaw at the trunk.Every day they gnawed a little more, until it seemed as if they would gnaw the trunk right through.Then one day a great storm shook the forest. The wind roared through the trees. It was so strong the woodpecker gave up tapping, and so for once, the owl slept in peace. The owl's tree began to creak and crack and groan as the wind grew more and more fierce, but the tired owl slept soundly on.Suddenly the woodpecker saw the owl's tree begin to away and fall. At once he struggled bravely through the storm and tapped loudly close to the owl's ear to wake him. The owl woke up in a fury, hearing the woodpecker tapping on his tree, but when realized his tree was being blown down his anger quickly disappeared. Together the woodpecker and the owl struggled to safety just as the tree crashed to the ground.Then the storm died away, and the owl thanked the woodpecker for saving his life. Now he was glad that the woodpecker had been his neighbor.--------------------------------The map below is called the story grammar map. Write the missing elements of the story in it.

                                            " THE OWL AND THE WOODPECKER"Once upon a time, in a a forest far away, there lived a woodpecker. The woodpecker lived in a tree in which he slept all night and worked all day.In the tree next door, there came to live an owl who liked to work all night and slept all day.The woodpecker worked so hard and made so much noise that his tapping woke the owl. You see, a woodpecker pecks at the wood and makes a continuous tapping sound."I say, you there!" screeched the owl. "How can I possibly sleep with all that noise going on?""This is my three," the woodpecker said, "and I shall tap it as I please."The owl lost his temper. His screeches and hoots echoed through the forest and animals for miles came running to see what was the matter."You carry on tapping, Master Woodpecker," squeked the mouse. "Owl is always bossing and chasing us about,""Oh, do be quiet," growled the bear, "Woodpecker, stop tapping and let Owl sleep. We like a peaceful life around here."Angrily, the owl swooped down on the small animals who ran for their lives and hid in all kinds of curious places. "Bully," they shouted when they were very safe.Then the owl ask the bigger animals what he could do to stop the noise but they all shook their heads. "How should we know?" they said. "You are the wise and clever one. Perhaps you could move to another tree.""Why should I?" snapped the owl. "I like living in this tree. That noisy woodpecker must move."But the woodpecker would not move. Day after day, his noisy tapping kept the owl awake. And day after the day the became more and more bad-tempered. He began to be so crotchety and rude that all the other animals decided that something must be done.So they held a meeting."Something must be dome," said the badger."Woodpecker was here first, so owl must leave.""But he says he will not leave his tree," replied the Deer"In that case we shall have to push down the tree, and then he will have to leave," said the crafty Fox.That night, while the owl was out hunting they all tried to push down tree. But no matter how hard they pushed and pulled and panted they could not move the tree the smallest bit. So they gave up and went back home.Some time later, two strangers came to the forest. They were a pair of beavers, and the took fancy to the owl's tree, and started to gnaw at the trunk.Every day they gnawed a little more, until it seemed as if they would gnaw the trunk right through.Then one day a great storm shook the forest. The wind roared through the trees. It was so strong the woodpecker gave up tapping, and so for once, the owl slept in peace. The owl's tree began to creak and crack and groan as the wind grew more and more fierce, but the tired owl slept soundly on.Suddenly the woodpecker saw the owl's tree begin to away and fall. At once he struggled bravely through the storm and tapped loudly close to the owl's ear to wake him. The owl woke up in a fury, hearing the woodpecker tapping on his tree, but when realized his tree was being blown down his anger quickly disappeared. Together the woodpecker and the owl struggled to safety just as the tree crashed to the ground.Then the storm died away, and the owl thanked the woodpecker for saving his life. Now he was glad that the woodpecker had been his neighbor.btw,nasa pic yung question^-^ pa answer na po ngayun:(​</a>

I have learned many facts about owls. First, most owls are nocturnal which means they hunt at night. Next, owls can not move their eyes in the socket so they must turn their entire head. Finally, the smallest owl is the Elf Owl which is six inches long and has wingspan of 15 inches. Owls are very interesting birds.

                            9. Directions: Read the passage. Then, answer the questions.             The Snowy Owl Among North American birds, the snowy owl ranks first in size. It can reach 27 inches in length and have a wingspan of 5 feet. The snowy owl is light for its size- about four pounds. It is easily distinguished from other large owls within its habitat by its predominately white plumage. The adult has few natural enemies, but eggs and juveniles are in danger from Arctic foxes and husky dogs. Owls depend on their keen sense of hearing and the efficiency of their sight, which is designed to work well in the dark. Unlike most other owls that primarily hunt at night, the snowy owl is diurnal, making it well- suited to survive in the far north where it can be continuously light or dark around the clock. These owls mainly feed on lemmings, voles, and rabbits but are known to eat other birds and fish as well. The snowy owl can fly long distances carrying an animal weighing far more than itself. 1. Where is the snowy owl's habitat? How can you tell?_ 2. What color plumage do other owls of the region have? How can you tell? 3. Does the snowy owl hunt during the day, at night, or both? What word tells you? 4. Is the snowy owl a carnivore or herbivore? How can you tell? 5. Could the snowy owl carry off a rabbit weighing five pounds? How do you know? ​</h2><br />
                        <p>1. The snowy owl's habitat is in the far north. You can tell because it is mentioned in the passage that the snowy owl is well-suited to survive in the far north where it can be continuously light or dark around the clock.</p><p></p><p>2. The passage does not provide information on the color plumage of other owls of the region.</p><p></p><p>3. The snowy owl hunts during the day. The word "diurnal" in the passage tells us that the snowy owl is active during the day.</p><p></p><p>4. The snowy owl is a carnivore. You can tell from the passage that the snowy owl mainly feeds on lemmings, voles, and rabbits but is known to eat other birds and fish as well.</p><p></p><p>5. Yes, the snowy owl could carry off a rabbit weighing five pounds. The passage states that the snowy owl can fly long distances carrying an animal weighing far more than itself. Since the snowy owl weighs about four pounds, it is capable of carrying off a rabbit weighing five pounds.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.

You see, a woodpecker pecks at the wood and makes a continuous tapping sound."I say, you there!" screeched the owl. "How can I possibly sleep with all that noise going on?""This is my three," the woodpecker said, "and I shall tap it as I please."The owl lost his temper. His screeches and hoots echoed through the forest and animals for miles came running to see what was the matter."You carry on tapping, Master Woodpecker," squeked the mouse. "Owl is always bossing and chasing us about,""Oh, do be quiet," growled the bear, "Woodpecker, stop tapping and let Owl sleep.

Two soldiers from the Northern army, a sergeant, and a captain immediately surround him, awaiting the execution. Beyond them, armed sentinels stand at attention. The bridge is bordered on one side by forest and, across the stream, open ground that gives way to a small hillock on which a small fort has been erected. A motionless company of infantrymen, led by their lieutenant, stands assembled before the fort. As the two soldiers finalize the preparations, they step back and remove the individual planks on which they had been standing. The sergeant salutes the captain then positions himself on the opposite end of the board supporting Farquhar, as the captain, like the soldiers, steps off and away from the crossties.</p><br />

The woodpecker lived in a tree in which he slept all night and worked all day.In the tree next door, there came to live an owl who liked to work all night and slept all day.The woodpecker worked so hard and made so much noise that his tapping woke the owl. You see, a woodpecker pecks at the wood and makes a continuous tapping sound."I say, you there!" screeched the owl. "How can I possibly sleep with all that noise going on?""This is my three," the woodpecker said, "and I shall tap it as I please."The owl lost his temper. His screeches and hoots echoed through the forest and animals for miles came running to see what was the matter."You carry on tapping, Master Woodpecker," squeked the mouse. "Owl is always bossing and chasing us about,""Oh, do be quiet," growled the bear, "Woodpecker, stop tapping and let Owl sleep. We like a peaceful life around here."Angrily, the owl swooped down on the small animals who ran for their lives and hid in all kinds of curious places. "Bully," they shouted when they were very safe.Then the owl ask the bigger animals what he could do to stop the noise but they all shook their heads. "How should we know?" they said. "You are the wise and clever one. Perhaps you could move to another tree.""Why should I?" snapped the owl. "I like living in this tree. That noisy woodpecker must move."But the woodpecker would not move. Day after day, his noisy tapping kept the owl awake. And day after the day the became more and more bad-tempered. He began to be so crotchety and rude that all the other animals decided that something must be done.So they held a meeting."Something must be dome," said the badger."Woodpecker was here first, so owl must leave.""But he says he will not leave his tree," replied the Deer"In that case we shall have to push down the tree, and then he will have to leave," said the crafty Fox.That night, while the owl was out hunting they all tried to push down tree. But no matter how hard they pushed and pulled and panted they could not move the tree the smallest bit. So they gave up and went back home.Some time later, two strangers came to the forest. They were a pair of beavers, and the took fancy to the owl's tree, and started to gnaw at the trunk.Every day they gnawed a little more, until it seemed as if they would gnaw the trunk right through.Then one day a great storm shook the forest. The wind roared through the trees. It was so strong the woodpecker gave up tapping, and so for once, the owl slept in peace. The owl's tree began to creak and crack and groan as the wind grew more and more fierce, but the tired owl slept soundly on.Suddenly the woodpecker saw the owl's tree begin to away and fall. At once he struggled bravely through the storm and tapped loudly close to the owl's ear to wake him. The owl woke up in a fury, hearing the woodpecker tapping on his tree, but when realized his tree was being blown down his anger quickly disappeared. Together the woodpecker and the owl struggled to safety just as the tree crashed to the ground.Then the storm died away, and the owl thanked the woodpecker for saving his life. Now he was glad that the woodpecker had been his neighbor.btw,nasa pic yung question^-^ pa answer na po ngayun:(​</h2><br />
