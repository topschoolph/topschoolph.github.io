2.Why did Willy tell Howard about Dave Singleman?  
3. Do you think all the presented ideas are related? Discuss your answer. </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong>. Willy's mood at the start of Act II is upbeat because he believes that his son Biff has finally realized his true potential and will be successful in business. Willy thinks that Biff has finally grown up and is ready to make something of himself, which makes him proud and optimistic about the future.</p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong>. Willy tells Howard about Dave Singleman, a legendary salesman who was able to do business just by making a phone call. He tells Howard about how Singleman was able to get customers to buy from him, even though he never went out to see them in person. Willy talks about Singleman as a symbol of the old-fashioned, personal approach to sales that he believes has been lost in the modern world. He hopes to convince Howard to give him a non-traveling job that would allow him to make sales over the phone.</p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong>. The presented ideas in these questions are related in the sense that they all revolve around the central theme of the play, which is the American Dream and its failures. Willy's upbeat mood and expectations for Biff's success are tied to his belief in the American Dream, which promises that hard work and determination will lead to success and happiness. Willy's story about Dave Singleman is also related to this theme, as it highlights the idea of the "self-made man" who achieves success through hard work and personal relationships. However, the play ultimately shows the darker side of the American Dream, as Willy and his family struggle to achieve success and happiness despite their best efforts.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#;)</p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong>[tex] \: [/tex]<p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Why is Willy's mood upbeat at the start of Act II? </strong></p>Willy's mood is upbeat because he is excited and full of hope for his son Biff whose inquiring for a loan to start his own business.<p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong><strong>What does he expect to happen? </strong></p>Willy thinks he's going to talk to his boss Howard and get an advance and a non-traveling job in New York, expects to hear good news about the loan from his sons.<p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Why did Willy tell Howard about Dave Singleman? </strong></p>Willy tells Howard about Dave Singleman because he wants a non-traveling job that still embodies what Willy believes in.<p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Do you think all the presented ideas are related? Discuss your answer.</strong></p>Yes because after many years on the road as a traveling salesman, Willy Loman realizes he has been a failure as a father and a husband. His sons, Happy and Biff, are not successful or any others. His career fading, Willy escapes into dreamy reminiscences of an idealized past. In the play’s climactic scene, Biff prepares to leave home, starts arguing with Willy, confesses that he has spent three months in jail, and mocks his father’s belief in “a smile and a shoeshine.” Willy, bitter and broken, his illusions shattered, commits suicide.<p><strong>Hope this helps &lt;3</strong></p><br />

If Willy doesn't sell well, it won't adversely affect the companyHoward is <strong>tired of listening to Willy's rambling exaggerations and references</strong> to times when Willy's working for his father.  <strong>Willy working in New York would be a nuisance. </strong><p>For more related topics about Death of a Salesman Act II  see the links below:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1386814</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1308400</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1320022</p><br />

                            30. Why is it hard for Biff to tell Willy the truth?</h2><br />
                        It was hard for Biff to tell Willy the truth because his father still thought of him as this kid who was on the top of his game, but in reality Biff was not any like his father’s delusions. <br />
