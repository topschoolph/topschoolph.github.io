                    <p>Exercise B Directions: Read the following paragraph and answer the following questions on a separate sheet of paper. The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrolees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Education Association (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd&#039;s writing implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. Source: Barrot, Jessie S., Academic Reading &amp;amp; Writing for Senior High School.

                                            please tell me what is the main idea of this article. Its a quantitative research In a recent correspondence, the authors suggested that secondary schools must adhere to health protocols and national and international guidelines so that the delivery of face-to-face classes will not risk students’ and educators’ health. With this, this paper proposes that even in higher education, a well-planned execution of face-to-face classes must be done. Thus, the gradual reopening of face-to-face classes becomes a necessity in order to gain a sense of normalcy in the middle of a pandemic. A recent correspondence tackled the adherence of secondary schools to health protocols as a significant factor in the delivery of face-to-face classes, following national and international guidelines in mitigating the effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).1 This article highlights how, in the Philippines, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Department of Health have prepared a joint memorandum circular regarding the guidelines on the gradual reopening of limited face-to-face classes of higher education institutions (HEIs). Face-to-face classes are limited to students of medicine and allied health courses. Campuses in areas under general community quarantine and modified general community quarantine are only allowed to reoperate physically with programs on medicine, nursing, medical technology, medical laboratory science, physical therapy, midwifery and public health.2 For students and school staff, bringing of face masks, face shields and other personal hygiene kits, such as ethyl alcohol (70%), hand sanitizer, cleansing wipes/tissue/hand towel and hand soap, is required.2 They are discouraged to buy food outside the campus to avoid physical contact during breaktime periods. They are to eat in their assigned seats inside classrooms with clear partition because they will remove their face masks and face shields while eating and drinking. They are to stay at home when they are symptomatic. Only students who are least 20 years in age are allowed to attend face-to-face classes. For HEIs, collaboration with the local government units is needed, with a presented contingency plan for resumption of the limited physical classes. The maximum number of students should be allowed, provided that a distance of 1.5 m must be observed between each student.2 Moreover, extracurricular activities are banned to avoid mass gatherings. Schools shall re-design the layouts of their facilities to ensure physical distancing.2 Health declaration forms and body temperature are still to be taken at the entrance of the school premises. Another responsibility of the school administrators is to ensure the transparent partition between the faculty and the students while classes are ongoing. School libraries are also open with limited time to encourage students to maximize the use of online library services.2 Also, all school facilities and equipment are to be cleaned and disinfected regularly. Without prior notice, the CHED may order the immediate suspension of any school that will violate health protocols and other provisions prescribed under the circular. This effort of the Philippine government is to augment the number of health workers during this pandemic.3 A youth group in the country, however, clamors that the government must not allow face-to-face classes until the vaccination program takes place,4 which is a hot issue nowadays.5 Ultimately, the gradual reopening of face-to-face classes becomes a necessity in order to gain a sense of normalcy in the middle of a pandemic.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. The author's stand on the implementation of SHS is not clear from the given text. While the author presents both the commendable intention and the concerns of critics, the text does not explicitly state whether the author is for or against the implementation of SHS.</strong></p><p><strong>2. The central claim of the text is that the implementation of the K to 12 Program in the Philippines, particularly the addition of two years of Senior High School (SHS), has both positive and negative effects on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>3. The target reader of the text is likely to be educators, policymakers, and the general public who are interested in the current state of education in the Philippines and the effects of the K to 12 Program on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>4. When the text was written, the implementation of the K to 12 Program, which adds two years of Senior High School (SHS) to the Philippines' educational system, was ongoing. The author discusses the program's aim, which includes providing students with more time to master concepts and skills, preparing them for higher education and middle-level skills development, and producing lifelong learners. The author also highlights some concerns and criticisms of the program, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, and the potential loss of revenues for colleges and universities. The author also notes that while some people criticize the implementation of SHS, others praise it, indicating that it is a controversial issue that has elicited different reactions from various stakeholders. The text aims to provide information about the implementation of the K to 12 Program and to present different perspectives on its effectiveness and impact.</strong></p><p><strong>5. The text presents both the positive and negative effects of the implementation of SHS. There are valid concerns raised by critics, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, as well as the potential revenue loss of colleges and universities. However, the DepEd is optimistic that these problems will be addressed, and some private educational associations commend the implementation of the K to 12 Program. Therefore, there is evidence both for and against SHS, and it is up to policymakers and stakeholders to carefully weigh these factors when making decisions about education reform.<br />6. The effectiveness of the implementation of SHS in the Philippines is a matter of ongoing debate, and opinions may vary depending on various factors, such as personal experiences, beliefs, and the current state of education in the country. Some people may argue that the additional two years of education provide students with more time to develop their skills and prepare for their future careers. On the other hand, others may argue that it is too long and puts a strain on students and their families, especially those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Based on my knowledge, I cannot make a definitive statement on whether SHS should continue to be implemented or not. However, it is essential to evaluate the implementation of SHS continually, monitor its effects, and address any issues that may arise to ensure that it benefits its stakeholders and achieves its intended goals.</strong></p><br />

                            3. please tell me what is the main idea of this article. Its a quantitative research In a recent correspondence, the authors suggested that secondary schools must adhere to health protocols and national and international guidelines so that the delivery of face-to-face classes will not risk students’ and educators’ health. With this, this paper proposes that even in higher education, a well-planned execution of face-to-face classes must be done. Thus, the gradual reopening of face-to-face classes becomes a necessity in order to gain a sense of normalcy in the middle of a pandemic. A recent correspondence tackled the adherence of secondary schools to health protocols as a significant factor in the delivery of face-to-face classes, following national and international guidelines in mitigating the effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).1 This article highlights how, in the Philippines, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Department of Health have prepared a joint memorandum circular regarding the guidelines on the gradual reopening of limited face-to-face classes of higher education institutions (HEIs). Face-to-face classes are limited to students of medicine and allied health courses. Campuses in areas under general community quarantine and modified general community quarantine are only allowed to reoperate physically with programs on medicine, nursing, medical technology, medical laboratory science, physical therapy, midwifery and public health.2 For students and school staff, bringing of face masks, face shields and other personal hygiene kits, such as ethyl alcohol (70%), hand sanitizer, cleansing wipes/tissue/hand towel and hand soap, is required.2 They are discouraged to buy food outside the campus to avoid physical contact during breaktime periods. They are to eat in their assigned seats inside classrooms with clear partition because they will remove their face masks and face shields while eating and drinking. They are to stay at home when they are symptomatic. Only students who are least 20 years in age are allowed to attend face-to-face classes. For HEIs, collaboration with the local government units is needed, with a presented contingency plan for resumption of the limited physical classes. The maximum number of students should be allowed, provided that a distance of 1.5 m must be observed between each student.2 Moreover, extracurricular activities are banned to avoid mass gatherings. Schools shall re-design the layouts of their facilities to ensure physical distancing.2 Health declaration forms and body temperature are still to be taken at the entrance of the school premises. Another responsibility of the school administrators is to ensure the transparent partition between the faculty and the students while classes are ongoing. School libraries are also open with limited time to encourage students to maximize the use of online library services.2 Also, all school facilities and equipment are to be cleaned and disinfected regularly. Without prior notice, the CHED may order the immediate suspension of any school that will violate health protocols and other provisions prescribed under the circular. This effort of the Philippine government is to augment the number of health workers during this pandemic.3 A youth group in the country, however, clamors that the government must not allow face-to-face classes until the vaccination program takes place,4 which is a hot issue nowadays.5 Ultimately, the gradual reopening of face-to-face classes becomes a necessity in order to gain a sense of normalcy in the middle of a pandemic.​</h2><br />
