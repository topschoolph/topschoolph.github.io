                                            1. is a special type of sewing machine that cuts the raw edges of the seam and creates overlocked stitches around the edge as it is sewn. 2. is a narrow strip of fabric that can be folded over an exposed seam to secure and hide the edges. This is often used for unlined garments and bags, and for the edges of quilts.3. these are serrated scissors that create a zigzag edge. Trimming a seam allowance with the pinking shears can prevent fraying.4. a lapped seam is typically used with fabrics that don't fray, such as leather and fleece. For a lapped seam, the right side of the fabric faces up and the pieces overlap, instead of right or wrong sides together. 5. is also frequently used for jeans, as it is very strong, but it is less bulky than the flat-felled seam because it is not enclosed and the raw edge of the fabric is visible. 6. is an extremely strong closed seam that is often used for items like jeans. It covers the fabric's raw edges well and keeps the seam flat. 7. it looks like a French Seam on the rigth side of the fabric. There are no visible stitches on the rigth side of the fabric, and on the opposite side, the fabric edges are neatly enclosed. 8.- it should only be used on delicate, lightweight fabric, like chiffon or organza, as the seam uses a lot of material and can get bulky with heavier fabric. French seam is also great for garments where you want to hide the seams, like an unlined jacket. 9. this type of seam is just like a plain seam except there are two lines of stitching attaching the fabric for extra strenth. 10. is the simplest type of seam and can be used on almost any item. A plain seam is defines as any seam that attaches two pieces of fabric together with the wrong sides facing. 11. while the zigzag stitch is good for stitching buttonhole. Most sewing machines have the capability to create buttonholes with a special foot attachment or a pre- programmed buttonhole setting. 12 this stitch is mainly a mix of striaght stitches and zigzag stitches. It's perfect for hemming and mending, especially because its nearly invisible. 13. most sewing machines will have a zigzag stitch option. You won't need to go over the fabric multiple times with this stitch as its solid and will keep seams from fraying. It is also a great stitch for making buttonholes. 14. when you're ready to move off of the hand stitching and onto sewing machine stitching, this is the first stitch you need to know. 15. This is useful for finishing the edges of blankets or for creating buttoholes. 16. this is useful when you're trying to sew hems so that you can't see stitches. It's good for patchwork 17. before the age of sewing machines, this stitch was used to crate all clothing.layer after layer of backstitches createda pattern of threads that people could wear. Its astrong stitch. 18. You've probably heard of cross-stitching before. Cross stitching is suitable for finishing hems and for designs that are front-facing. This stitch is strictly more nuanced than the running or basting stitches. 19 this stitch is just the running stitch but longer. Instead of making your stitches a centimeter apart, make them ½ inch apart from each other. 20. this stitch is the most basic of all the hand sewing stitches and if you stitch.​</a>

                            4. 1. is a special type of sewing machine that cuts the raw edges of the seam and creates overlocked stitches around the edge as it is sewn. 2. is a narrow strip of fabric that can be folded over an exposed seam to secure and hide the edges. This is often used for unlined garments and bags, and for the edges of quilts.3. these are serrated scissors that create a zigzag edge. Trimming a seam allowance with the pinking shears can prevent fraying.4. a lapped seam is typically used with fabrics that don't fray, such as leather and fleece. For a lapped seam, the right side of the fabric faces up and the pieces overlap, instead of right or wrong sides together. 5. is also frequently used for jeans, as it is very strong, but it is less bulky than the flat-felled seam because it is not enclosed and the raw edge of the fabric is visible. 6. is an extremely strong closed seam that is often used for items like jeans. It covers the fabric's raw edges well and keeps the seam flat. 7. it looks like a French Seam on the rigth side of the fabric. There are no visible stitches on the rigth side of the fabric, and on the opposite side, the fabric edges are neatly enclosed. 8.- it should only be used on delicate, lightweight fabric, like chiffon or organza, as the seam uses a lot of material and can get bulky with heavier fabric. French seam is also great for garments where you want to hide the seams, like an unlined jacket. 9. this type of seam is just like a plain seam except there are two lines of stitching attaching the fabric for extra strenth. 10. is the simplest type of seam and can be used on almost any item. A plain seam is defines as any seam that attaches two pieces of fabric together with the wrong sides facing. 11. while the zigzag stitch is good for stitching buttonhole. Most sewing machines have the capability to create buttonholes with a special foot attachment or a pre- programmed buttonhole setting. 12 this stitch is mainly a mix of striaght stitches and zigzag stitches. It's perfect for hemming and mending, especially because its nearly invisible. 13. most sewing machines will have a zigzag stitch option. You won't need to go over the fabric multiple times with this stitch as its solid and will keep seams from fraying. It is also a great stitch for making buttonholes. 14. when you're ready to move off of the hand stitching and onto sewing machine stitching, this is the first stitch you need to know. 15. This is useful for finishing the edges of blankets or for creating buttoholes. 16. this is useful when you're trying to sew hems so that you can't see stitches. It's good for patchwork 17. before the age of sewing machines, this stitch was used to crate all clothing.layer after layer of backstitches createda pattern of threads that people could wear. Its astrong stitch. 18. You've probably heard of cross-stitching before. Cross stitching is suitable for finishing hems and for designs that are front-facing. This stitch is strictly more nuanced than the running or basting stitches. 19 this stitch is just the running stitch but longer. Instead of making your stitches a centimeter apart, make them ½ inch apart from each other. 20. this stitch is the most basic of all the hand sewing stitches and if you stitch.​</h2><br />

A seam finish is a treatment that secures and neatens the raw edges of a plain seam to prevent raveling, by sewing over the raw edges or enclosing them in some sort of binding. On mass-produced clothing, the seam allowances of plain seams are usually trimmed and stitched together with an overlock stitch using a serger.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong</p><br />
