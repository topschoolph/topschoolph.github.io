Now that you know the different kinds of electrical hand tools and its definition and description, you are ready to explore more by answering the activity below Directions. Identify what is called for Write answers in your activity notebook 1. Panel board is a material for electrical line which divides an electrical power supply into different lines with a different breaker rates protecting for each line in a collective attachment 2. Entrance Cap assembly is often called a сар. . 3. Lock nut specially designed to inhibit its coming loose. It is usually having a means of providing extra between tube and the screw 4. Receptacle is an electrical which the plug of an electrical device may be implanted. 5. Photocell switch is essentially a light dependent 6. Switch is an electrical part that can disconnect or connect the conducting path in an electrical interfering the electric current or distracting it from one conductor to another. 7. An air condition outlet connects your air conditioner appliance with the desired source. This is very different to a usual outlet because of the ability to vary in current rating in which an air conditioner appliance needs higher current 8. are points on the wiring installation at which current is taken to supply utilization equipment Receptacle is a contact component installed at the outlet for the connection of plug. 9. Elbow is installed between two lengths of tube to allow revise of direction, usually a 90° or 45° angle. 10. Condulet has body with one open longitudinal side and curved ends, and conduit coupling cores at various locations on the body.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Tools
</strong></p><p><strong>There is much more to tools for electronics than just screwdrivers and
</strong></p><p><strong>pliers. While most of the common tools can be found at a local hardware or
</strong></p><p><strong>home improvement store, many are unique to the electronics
</strong></p><p><strong>industry. These specialized tools have evolved over many years, in some
</strong></p><p><strong>cases starting out as modified versions of common hardware store types,
</strong></p><p><strong>and in other cases designed from the outset to fulfill a specific need.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>For the most part, you shouldn’t need to spend a lot of money on odd-ball
</strong></p><p><strong>tools if you stick to the common hardware described in not available
</strong></p><p><strong>and avoid things like surface-mounted components with ultra-fine pitch leads.
</strong></p><p><strong>If you need to use an integrated circuit (IC) with something like 144 leads with hair-width spaces between the leads, then you should probably consider paying someone to mount it for you using screened solder paste and a reflow soldering system. For just a single project, it might not be worth the expense of acquiring a decent bench microscope and a fancy surface-mount soldering station and then learning to use it.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>This chapter is a survey of some of the common tools you should consider
</strong></p><p><strong>owning for working with modern electronics. It is not intended to be a
</strong></p><p><strong>definitive or comprehensive guide. There are hand tools, power tools, and
</strong></p><p><strong>bench-mounted tools for tightening, cutting, drilling, and trimming. Other
</strong></p><p><strong>tools are used for soldering, inspecting, and finishing. I would suggest
</strong></p><p><strong>obtaining a selection of catalogs from companies such as Digikey and Mouser
</strong></p><p><strong>and perusing the tool sections. If you have a good electronics supply
</strong></p><p><strong>outlet nearby, it might be useful to browse its display racks to get an
</strong></p><p><strong>idea of what’s available and examine the tools in person.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Screwdrivers
</strong></p><p><strong>For every screw type there is a screwdriver. For most tasks, a basic selection
</strong></p><p><strong>of screwdrivers, such as the ones shown in Figure 1-1, is all you’ll need.
</strong></p><p><strong>
