Do you feel snappish when the cables and programs of local stations go haywire? Have you become TV-dependent? If you have become one, you are not an isolate. In fact, parents nowadays may not be aware that the pervasiveness of TV in their children's lives is a cause for concern. Extensive TV viewing has undesirable consequences. First, it affects behavior. After observing role models engaged in violent behavior, the child tends to imitate and add violent behavior to his repertoire. Second, TV affects the young mind's attitude toward family life as it greatly reduces family interactions and seldom portrays family life realistically because the programs are either funny and simplistic or expressively tragic. Third, TV affects the emotional development, too. Because of repeated stimulation, the children are desensitized to the pain and suffering of others. Fourth, undoubtedly, the moral climate on TV is often against Christian teachings and sound moral values. Pre- or extra-marital sex is nothing wrong or unusual. Even laughing at people with defects has become acceptable. Finally, long hours of TV viewing can bring about grave cognitive consequences. It promotes passive rather than active learning. Moreover, the attention in inertia can cause children to get glued and fixated to the boob tube. No wonder they are impatient with extended class sessions. Many children have problems of concentration and hyperacidity, too, as a consequence of skipped meals or irregular eating habits. Therefore, while there are justifiable reasons for watching TV, prolonged TV viewing certainly does not justify the reasons.</a>

In this lesson, we looked into the (2) disciplines of Anthropology and Sociology They are "sisters" in a sense because their interests in choosing a subject of study are almost similar, but their interpretations vary: Anthropology focuses on the (3) side, while Sociology focuses on the side: Anthropology studies humans in general, and Sociology studies human interactions. This lesson also defined culture and social structures. Culture was defined using 16) classic definition; it is everything man-made that is used to adapt, and interact with the physical and social environment of man (ex: clothing, rituals, celebrations, symbols, language, etc.). On the other hand, Social structures or 17 are patterns of our social interactions.

Do you feel snappish when the cables and programs of local stations go haywire? Have you become TV-dependent? If you have become one, you are not an isolate. In fact, parents nowadays may not be aware that the pervasiveness of TV in their children's lives is a cause for concern. Extensive TV viewing has undesirable consequences. First, it affects behavior. After observing role models engaged in violent behavior, the child tends to imitate and add violent behavior to his repertoire. Second, TV affects the young mind's attitude toward family life as it greatly reduces family interactions and seldom portrays family life realistically because the programs are either funny and simplistic or expressively tragic. Third, TV affects the emotional development, too. Because of repeated stimulation, the children are desensitized to the pain and suffering of others. Fourth, undoubtedly, the moral climate on TV is often against Christian teachings and sound moral values. Pre- or extra-marital sex is nothing wrong or unusual. Even laughing at people with defects has become acceptable. Finally, long hours of TV viewing can bring about grave cognitive consequences. It promotes passive rather than active learning. Moreover, the attention in inertia can cause children to get glued and fixated to the boob tube. No wonder they are impatient with extended class sessions. Many children have problems of concentration and hyperacidity, too, as a consequence of skipped meals or irregular eating habits. Therefore, while there are justifiable reasons for watching TV, prolonged TV viewing certainly does not justify the reasons.</h2><br />

                            13. What I Have Learned Let's look into what we have learned so far. Fill in the missing words to complete the thought of the following paragraphs. Social Sciences are interrelated and interconnected disciplines that study man's social aspect. There are a handful of Social Science disciplines, and the way to distinguish them from each other is to look at their different (1) or focus of study. In this lesson, we looked into the (2) disciplines of Anthropology and Sociology They are "sisters" in a sense because their interests in choosing a subject of study are almost similar, but their interpretations vary: Anthropology focuses on the (3) side, while Sociology focuses on the side: Anthropology studies humans in general, and Sociology studies human interactions. This lesson also defined culture and social structures. Culture was defined using 16) classic definition; it is everything man-made that is used to adapt, and interact with the physical and social environment of man (ex: clothing, rituals, celebrations, symbols, language, etc.). On the other hand, Social structures or 17 are patterns of our social interactions. Family, friends, religion, economy, and mass media are some examples of structures or patterns of our interactions​</h2><br />
