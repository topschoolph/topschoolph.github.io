The entry of lymph takes significantly longer than that of blood. Blood is a liquid comprising of plasma, red platelets, white platelets, and platelets that is flowed by the heart through the vertebrate vascular system, conveying oxygen and supplements to and squander materials from all body tissues. Lymph is basically reused abundance blood plasma after it has been sifted from the interstitial liquid and got back to the lymphatic system. The <strong>cardiovascular system</strong> involves the blood, heart, and veins. The lymph, lymph hubs, and lymph vessels structure the lymphatic system, which returns sifted blood plasma from the interstitial liquid as lymph.
</p><p>
</p><p>The <strong>circulatory system </strong>of the blood has two parts, a systemic flow and a pneumonic course. While people and different vertebrates have a shut <strong>cardiovascular system</strong>, some invertebrate gatherings have an open <strong>cardiovascular system</strong>. The lymphatic system, conversely, is an open system giving an extra course to overabundance interstitial liquid to be gotten back to the blood. The more crude, diploblastic creature phyla need circulatory systems.</p><p></p><p>CIRCULATORY SYSTEM CONCEPT MAP:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/3373981</p><p></p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />

The sagging skin on cows is a result of their size and weight, which puts pressure on their skin and causes it to stretch and sag.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, carabaos are native to the Philippines and are adapted to the hot and humid climate. They have tight skin that helps them regulate their body temperature and prevent water loss through sweating. Their skin is also tough and durable, which protects them from predators and allows them to graze in rough terrain.</p><p></p><p>So, the sagging skin of cows and the tight skin of carabaos are both adaptations that help them survive in their respective environments.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

 THE COW AND THE CARABAO

They went off without the farmer’s consent.
Before swimming, they hung their skins on a tree branch. But it wasn’t long till the farmer went looking for them. Upon seeing the farmer, they rushed to put on their skins. In their rush, the carabao had worn the cow’s skin and the cow had worn the carabao’s skin.
