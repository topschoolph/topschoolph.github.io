Write the correct letter on the line. Column A Column B A. The lateritic soils, ie, soils rich in oxides of aluminum, iron, and silicon are abundant in tropical regions. They are another good example of materials that provide strong interparticle bonds between particles in cyclic wetting and drying processes in nature. B. Electrical current is the movement of charged particles, either electrons or ions, through a conductor. A voltaic cell is an electrochemical cell that uses a chemical reaction to produce electrical energy. &lt; C. Negative ions are smaller and lighter and are more likely to become airbome while positive ions are heavier and tend to fall to the ground. Thus, the concentration of negative ions is greater in the atmosphere near moving water. Rainstorms, waterfalls, rain showers, rivers and crashing waves are natural negative ions generators. D. The shape of snowflakes results from bonding (and intermolecular) forces in H²O. The attractive force between a hydrogen atom is covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom and another. The snowflake is symmetrical. E. The formation of water molecules in these clouds collide with one another, chipping off electrons and creating an electric charge2. Fission occurs due to the separation between the positively and negatively charged particles in the upper and bottom portions of the clouds, respectively. At the same time, the negatively charged particles, or electrons, migrate to the bottom of the clouds. These electrons create a repulsion towards the electrons on the earth's surface that causes positively charged particles or protons to move up to the ground's surface.​</a>

                                            The picture above shows an electric circuit. An electric circuit is continuous path overwhich electrons move.An electrical circuit has four parts: a source, light bulb, wires, andswitch. The source of potential energy provides potential difference for the current to flow.The load is an electrical appliance. Here, the light bulb is the load. The load provides theresistance. The wire connects the various circuit components and provide a complete pathfor the current to flow. A switch is used to turn the current flow on and off. In the setup, awire is attached to the negative end of the battery, while the other wire is attached to thepositive end. Both wires are attached to the bulb. Such a circuit is called a closed circuit.A closed circuit makes the bulb light up because the path of electricity is complete,allowing electricity to flow through it. Electricity flows from the negative to the positiveterminal of the dry cell. Another kind of circuit is an open circuit. Electricity does not end ofthe circuit to the other end. To turn on the lights, you have to close the circuit by pushing theswitch on. To turn off the lights, you have to open the circuit again by pushing the switch off.Match the concept in column B with its description in column A.Column AColumn B1. circuit where electricity cannot flowa. battery2.

Column A Column B A. The lateritic soils, ie, soils rich in oxides of aluminum, iron, and silicon are abundant in tropical regions. They are another good example of materials that provide strong interparticle bonds between particles in cyclic wetting and drying processes in nature. B. Electrical current is the movement of charged particles, either electrons or ions, through a conductor. A voltaic cell is an electrochemical cell that uses a chemical reaction to produce electrical energy. &lt; C. Negative ions are smaller and lighter and are more likely to become airbome while positive ions are heavier and tend to fall to the ground. Thus, the concentration of negative ions is greater in the atmosphere near moving water. Rainstorms, waterfalls, rain showers, rivers and crashing waves are natural negative ions generators. D. The shape of snowflakes results from bonding (and intermolecular) forces in H²O. The attractive force between a hydrogen atom is covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom and another. The snowflake is symmetrical. E. The formation of water molecules in these clouds collide with one another, chipping off electrons and creating an electric charge2. Fission occurs due to the separation between the positively and negatively charged particles in the upper and bottom portions of the clouds, respectively. At the same time, the negatively charged particles, or electrons, migrate to the bottom of the clouds. These electrons create a repulsion towards the electrons on the earth's surface that causes positively charged particles or protons to move up to the ground's surface.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>ELECTRIC MOTOR<p></p><p>The world of electric motors is quite fascinating. For many making and collecting various types of electric motors is a hobby and for others making them to power various devices is a profession. Whatever the approach is, but these devices offer innumerable possibilities for improvisation.</p><p></p><p>Working with them and understanding them is a rewarding and learning experience. Let us find out more about these in general. Usually, they can be classified into two main types. They are direct current or DC and alternating current or AC motors. DC or AC is very common terms and they refer to how the electrical current is transferred through and from the motor. Both types of motors have different utilities and uses.</p>Answer: C Galvanometer or E Electric motor<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>#Carry On Learning#<br />

                            16. The picture above shows an electric circuit. An electric circuit is continuous path overwhich electrons move.An electrical circuit has four parts: a source, light bulb, wires, andswitch. The source of potential energy provides potential difference for the current to flow.The load is an electrical appliance. Here, the light bulb is the load. The load provides theresistance. The wire connects the various circuit components and provide a complete pathfor the current to flow. A switch is used to turn the current flow on and off. In the setup, awire is attached to the negative end of the battery, while the other wire is attached to thepositive end. Both wires are attached to the bulb. Such a circuit is called a closed circuit.A closed circuit makes the bulb light up because the path of electricity is complete,allowing electricity to flow through it. Electricity flows from the negative to the positiveterminal of the dry cell. Another kind of circuit is an open circuit. Electricity does not end ofthe circuit to the other end. To turn on the lights, you have to close the circuit by pushing theswitch on. To turn off the lights, you have to open the circuit again by pushing the switch off.Match the concept in column B with its description in column A.Column AColumn B1. circuit where electricity cannot flowa. battery2.

The pins, clips, and needles were attracted by the electromagnet. 48. What happens when a part of an electromagnet is disconnected? A. It loses its magnetism. B. The electricity continues to flow through it. C. The electromagnet becomes a permanent magnet D. There is an increase in the number of materials attracted. 49. Which material can be a conductor for an electromagnet? A. cotton B. copper C. plastic D. rubber 50. What kind of circuit is shown on the picture?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>C</strong> 47. The dry cell as the source of electricity is NOT a part of an electromagnet. The components of an electromagnet are the coiled wire and the magnetic core or material (such as a nail or a piece of iron). The dry cell is a source of electrical energy, but it is not a part of the electromagnet itself.</p><p></p><p><strong>A</strong><strong> </strong>48. If a part of an electromagnet is disconnected, it loses its magnetism. The magnetism of an electromagnet is created by the flow of electric current through the wire coil. If the circuit is broken or disconnected, the electric current stops flowing, and the magnetic field disappears.</p><p></p><p><strong>B</strong> 49. Copper can be a conductor for an electromagnet. Copper is a good conductor of electricity and is commonly used in electrical wiring and circuits. In an electromagnet, the coiled wire is often made of copper and is wrapped around the magnetic core to create a magnetic field when an electric current flows through the wire. Cotton, plastic, and rubber are not good conductors of electricity and cannot be used as conductors for electromagnets.</p><p></p><p>I can't answer number 50 because you didn't post the picture</p><p></p><p>Thank you for the points</p><p>➽➽➽➽➽➽➽➽➽➽➽➽➽➽➽</p><p>PA BRAINIEST</p><br />
