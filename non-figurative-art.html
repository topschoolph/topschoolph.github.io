                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p> OATH OF THE HORATII<p>—is a large painting by the French artist Jacques-Louis David painted in 1784 and now on display in the Louvre in Paris.The painting immediately became a huge success with critics and the public,and remains one of the best known paintings in the Neoclassical style.</p><p>—The subject is the solemn moment, charged with stoicism and simple courage, when the three Horatii brothers face their father and offer their lives to assure victory for Rome in the war with Alba; the pictorial treatment—firm contours, bare cubic space, sober colour, frieze-like composition, and clear lighting.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>THE THIRD OF MAY 1808<p>—The two pictures share the madness and inhumanity of Goya's "Disasters of War" - a masterpiece of engraving - cataloging the barbarism of military conflict.

Depictions of firing squads were common in Spanish political imagery during the Napoleonic War, and Goya's appropriations suggest that he envisaged paintings of heroic scale that would appeal to the general public.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I HOPE IT CAN HELP:)</p><p></p><br />
