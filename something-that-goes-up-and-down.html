This falling apple made Isaac suddenly realize that something must be pulling the apple down towards the Earth, and he thought up the Universal Law of Gravitation. While some of the details may be exaggerated, Newton does credit an apple tree as his inspiration for the Law of Gravity! 1. Do you believe that whatever goes up also goes down? 2.

This is that the Ocing The pull of gravity acts on all objects. So, when you drop something or even when you throw something up, it will go down Things thrown always follot a constant acceleration which has a magnitude of 9 8 ms. This means that the velocity of an object changes by 9.8 m/s every second of foll. Consider a boll thrown upward. As the ball goes up a decelerates until it stops momentorly and changes direction. That means, it reaches its maximum height before it starts to foll back to the point where it was thrown and its speed will be equal to the speed at which it was thrown. Note that the magnitudes of the two velocities are equal but they have opposite directions - velocity is upward when it was thrown, but downward when it retures Free fall is an example of unifomy occelerated motion, with its acceleration being -9.8 m/s negative because it is downward. The equchons for Unit Accelerated Motion (UAM) are: where; v = final velocity/speed * = initial velocity/speed a constant acceleration ) ord time d=distance/displacement - average speed/velocity​</a>

It's time to take a snack, it was recess time. Pupils are line up in waiting for their turns to go inside the canteen. Out of the crowd, Joselito seems down at the bench just looking around the kids eating and some are playing. He had no money to buy something because his father did not receive his salary yet. His mother told him to have a heavy breakfast for him to be full until lunch time. While waiting for the time to pass by, he suddenly saw fifty pesos on the ground. He said to himself, "lf! spend this money, I will be able to have lots to eat for recess." But, he knows that it is not the right thing to do. So, he goes to their classroom and asks for help from his adviser to find the owner of that money. It so happens that one of his classmates Irene was crying at the corner of their classroom because she lost her money, Joselito asks Irene how much she lost? "It's fifty pesos”, said Irene. Joselito gives the fifty pesos that he saw to Irene and said, "I think it's yours." Irene was so thankful to Joselito. As a form of her appreciation, she told Joselito to go to the canteen with her and they shared snacks for recess. Joselito was grateful that because of his honesty, he was able to enjoy his recess time.​</a>

                                            One Moment at Recess by Grace S. Ponce It was 10:00 in the morning at Mabuhay Elementary School. It's time to take a snack, it was recess time. Pupils are line up in waiting for their turns to go inside the canteen. Out of the crowd, Joselito seems down at the bench just looking around the kids eating and some are playing. He had no money to buy something because his father did not receive his salary yet. His mother told him to have a heavy breakfast for him to be full until lunch time. While waiting for the time to pass by, he suddenly saw fifty pesos on the ground. He said to himself, "If I spend this money, I will be able to have lots to eat for recess. But, he knows that it is not the right thing to do. So, he goes to their classroom and asks for help from his adviser to find the owner of that money. It so happens that one of his classmates Irene was crying at the corner of their classroom because she lost her money. Joselito asks Irene how much she lost? "It's fifty pesos", said Irene. Joselito gives the fifty pesos that he saw to Irene and said, "I think it's yours." Irene was so thankful to Joselito. As a form of her appreciation, she told Joselito to go to the canteen with her and they shared snacks for recess. Joselito was grateful that because of his honesty, he was able to enjoy his recess time.​</a>

                                            ONLY 5 QUESTIONS BUT READ THE STORY FIRST BEFORE ANSWERINGSTORY #1 The Donkey and the Mule A Peddler set off on his usual journey. All of the things he would sell along the way were packed on his donkey and his mule. The donkey walked along easily until they started up the steep mountain path. The poor little donkey’s load was more than he could bear. He begged the mule to take a little bit of his load, so that he could carry the rest more easily. But the mule paid no attention. At last they reached the top of the mountain where there was a small inn. The donkey was so exhausted that he fell to the ground. The next morning the donkey still could not get to his feet. Not knowing what else to do, the Peddler added the donkey’s load to the mule’s load, and went on without the donkey. The mule’s load was heavy, but his heart was even heavier. “If only I had helped the donkey just a little, I would not have a double load myself,” he reflected. STORY #2 The Peddler’s Mule A Peddler took his mule to the seacoast to buy salt. On the way home, they crossed a shallow stream where the mule accidentally slipped and fell. All of the salt in the bags dissolved, and the mule’s load was much lighter. The Peddler went back and bought even more salt than before. When they came to the stream, the mule fell down on purpose. When he got up, his load was again much lighter than before. The Peddler saw through the mule’s trick, and went back to the seacoast a third time. This time, instead of salt, he bought a cargo of sponges. Again, the mule fell down when they reached the stream. The sponges filled with water, and greatly increased his load. This time he had only tricked himself. THE QUESTIONS1. A Peddler goes on a trip. A. “The Donkey and the Mule” onlyB. Both storiesC. “The Peddler’s Mule” onlyD. Neither story2.

                                            One Moment at Recess
by: Grace S. Ponce
            It was 10:00 in the morning at Mabuhay Elementary School. It’s time to take a snack, it was recess time. Pupils are line up in waiting for their turns to go inside the canteen. Out of the crowd, Joselito seems down at the bench just looking around the kids eating and some are playing. He had to money to buy something because his father did not receive his salary yet. His mother told him to have a heavy breakfast for him to be full until lunch time. While waiting for the time to pass by, he suddenly saw fifty pesos on the ground. He said to himself, “If I spend this money, I will be able to have a lots to eat for recess.” But he knows that it is not the right thing to do. So, he goes to their classroom and asks for help from his adviser to find the owner of that money. It so happens that one of his classmates Irene was crying at the corner of their classroom because she lost her money. Joselito asks Irene how much she lost. “It’s fifty pesos”, said Irene. Joselito gives the fifty pesos that he saw to Irene and said, “I think it’s yours,” Irene was so thankful to Joselito. As a form of her appreciation, she told Joselito to go to the canteen with her and they shared snacks for recess. Joselito was grateful that because of his honesty, he was able to enjoy his recess time.

And with that, Alunsina suddenly disappeared, without a word or a trace to where she went. A few days passed, Tungkung Langit felt very lonely and longed for his wife. He realized that he should not have lost his temper. But it was too late, Ahunsina is gone. Their home which was once vibrant with Ahunsina's sweet voice, his home became cold and desolate. In the morning when he woke up, he would find himself alone. In the afternoon when he came home, he would feel loneliness creeping deep within him. sFor months Tungkung Langit lived in utter desolation. Try as he did he could not find Alunsina. And so in his desperation, he decided to do something to forget his sorrow and win back his wife's favor. So he came down to earth and planted trees and flowers that she may notice it, but she still didn't come home. Then in desperation, he took his wife's jewels and scattered them in the sky. He hoped that when Alunsina should see them she might be induced to return home. 6Ahnsina's necklace became the stars, her comb the moon, and her crown the sun. But in spite of all his efforts, Alunsina did not return home. Until now, as the story goes, Tungkung Langit lives alone in his palace in the skies and sometimes, he would cry out for Alunsina and his tears would fall down upon the earth as rain and his loud voice, calling out for his wife, was believed to be the thunder during storms, begging for her to come back to their heavenly palace once more. 5.

                                            Story:Death of a Salesman (Summary) A stage play written by Arthur Miller Willy Loman returns home exhausted after a business trip he has cancelled. Worried over Willy's state of mind and recent car accident, his wife Linda suggests that he ask his boss Howard Wagner to allow him to work in his home city so he will not have to travel. Willy complains to Linda that their son, Biff, has yet to do something with his life. Despite Biff's potential as a football star in high school, he failed in mathematics and was therefore unable to enter a university. Biff and his younger brother, Happy, who is temporarily staying with Willy and Linda after Biff's unexpected return from the West, reminisce about their childhood together. They discuss their father's mental degeneration, which they have witnessed in the form of his constant indecisiveness and daydreaming about the boys' high school years. Eventually, Willy walks in, angry that the two boys have never amounted to anything. In an effort to pacify their father, Biff and Happy tell him that Biff plans to make a business proposition the next day. The next day, Willy goes to ask Howard for a job in town while Biff goes to make a business proposition, but they both fail; Willy gets angry and ends up getting fired when Howard tells him he needs a rest and can no longer represent the company, while Biff waits hours to see a former employer who does not remember him and turns him down. Biff impulsively steals a fountain pen. Willy then goes to the office of his neighbor Charley, where he runs into Charley's son Bernard, now a successful lawyer. Bernard tells him that Biff originally wanted to go to summer school to make up for failing math, but something happened in Boston when Biff went to visit his father that changed his mind. Charley gives the now-unemployed Willy money to pay his life-insurance premium, and Willy shocks Charley by remarking that ultimately, a man is "worth more dead than alive." Happy, Biff, and Willy meet for dinner at a restaurant, but Willy refuses to hear bad news from Biff. Happy tries to get Biff to lie to their father. Biff tries to tell him what happened as Willy gets angry and slips into a flashback of what happened in Boston the day Biff came to see him: Willy had been in Boston for work, and Biff went to visit him to ask Willy to convince his teacher to curve Biff's failing math grade. Willy was in the middle of an affair with a receptionist, when Biff arrived unexpectedly at the hotel room, and saw the woman, who was half-dressed. Willy attempted to explain away her presence as an innocent borrowing of his shower, while her own room was undergoing renovations, but Biff is unconvinced and angrily dismisses Willie as a liar and a fake before storming out. From that moment, Biff's views of his father changed and set him adrift. Biff leaves the restaurant in frustration, followed by Happy and two girls that Happy picked up, leaving a confused and upset Willy behind. When they later return home, Linda angrily confronts them for abandoning their father while Willy remains outside, talking to himself. Biff tries to reconcile with Willy, but the discussion quickly escalates into another argument. Biff conveys plainly to his father that he is not meant for anything great, insisting that both of them are simply ordinary men meant to lead ordinary lives. The argument reaches an apparent climax as Biff hugs Willy and begins to cry as he tries to get Willy to let go of his unrealistic expectations. Rather than listen to what Biff actually says, Willy appears to believe his son has forgiven him and will follow in his footsteps, and after Linda goes upstairs to bed, lapses one final time into a hallucination, thinking he is talking to his long-dead brother Ben. In Willy's mind, Ben approves of the scheme Willy has dreamed up to kill himself in order to give Biff his insurance policy money. Willy exits the house, and Biff and Linda cry out in despair as the sound of Willy's car blares up and fades out. The final scene takes place at Willy's funeral, which is attended only by his family, Charley and Bernard. The ambiguities of mixed and unaddressed emotions persist, particularly over whether Willy's choices or circumstances were obsolete. At the funeral, Biff retains his belief that he does not want to become a businessman like his father. Happy, on the other hand, chooses to follow in his father's footsteps, while Linda laments her husband's decision just before her final payment on the house. QUESTION:1. How would you describe Willy as a father?2. What can you tell about the relationship of the family to each other?3. What led Willy to commit suicide? Is there a way that this could have been avoided? ​</a>

Wat Have Learned In the bible it is cited that, "What goes up, must come down" Philippians 2:1-11 Also, as the legend goes: Sir Isaac Newton, an English mathematician, physicist, and philosopher, was sitting under an apple tree when an apple fell on his head. This falling apple made Isaac suddenly realize that something must be pulling the apple down towards the Earth, and he thought up the Universal Law of Gravitation. While some of the details may be exaggerated, Newton does credit an apple tree as his inspiration for the Law of Gravity! 1. Do you believe that whatever goes up also goes down? 2.

It's time to take a snack, it was recess time. Pupils are line up in waiting for their turns to go inside the canteen. Out of the crowd, Joselito seems down at the bench just looking around the kids eating and some are playing. He had no money to buy something because his father did not receive his salary yet. His mother told him to have a heavy breakfast for him to be full until lunch time. While waiting for the time to pass by, he suddenly saw fifty pesos on the ground. He said to himself, "lf! spend this money, I will be able to have lots to eat for recess." But, he knows that it is not the right thing to do. So, he goes to their classroom and asks for help from his adviser to find the owner of that money. It so happens that one of his classmates Irene was crying at the corner of their classroom because she lost her money, Joselito asks Irene how much she lost? "It's fifty pesos”, said Irene. Joselito gives the fifty pesos that he saw to Irene and said, "I think it's yours." Irene was so thankful to Joselito. As a form of her appreciation, she told Joselito to go to the canteen with her and they shared snacks for recess. Joselito was grateful that because of his honesty, he was able to enjoy his recess time.​</h2><br />

Answer
#
First Statement
Second Statement
1.
The weather, climate, floods and others can decrease or increase product supply.
Nature has a major impact on the supply of products.
2.
There is an increase in quantity supply when there is an increase in the number of sellers.
Example of this is the wage of the laborers
3.
If the price of the product increases the demand will go down.
The cost of production pertains to the value of the factors of production like land, labor and capital used in processing the product.
4.
A substitute good refers to a product that can be used in replacement of another product.
If customers expect that price will increase in the future, the demand for a product at present will increase.
5.
Due to gender, women demand more lipstick and blush-on than men.
The increase in population/number of consumers is equated to an increase in demand for products.
6.
If an advertising campaign is successful, people tend to buy more of a product.
Consumer tastes are shaped by the way products are marketed to them.
7.
The demand is considered to be elastic
Common examples of products with high elasticity are luxury items and consumer discretionary items.
8.
Economic measure of how responsive the quality demanded for a good service is to a change in income.
Income Elasticity demand as one of the main types of demand elasticity.
9.
If the price of something goes up, the demand for it will go down.
The law of Supply
10.
The elasticity of demand is a measure of how demand reacts to price changes.
It is calculated by dividing the percentage change in quantity demand by the percentage change in price.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. For - Nature can indeed impact the supply of products.</p><p>2. Against - The second statement talks about the wage of laborers, which is not related to an increase in quantity supply due to an increase in the number of sellers.</p><p>3. For - The cost of production is a factor that can impact the price of a product and, in turn, affect the demand for it.</p><p>4. For - If customers expect the price of a product to increase in the future, the demand for it at present may increase as they try to avoid paying more later.</p><p>5. Against - The statement makes a generalization about women and men's preferences for cosmetics, which may not be true in all cases.</p><p>6. For - Successful advertising campaigns can indeed influence consumer behavior and increase the demand for a product.</p><p>7. For - Products with high elasticity, like luxury items, tend to have a more elastic demand.</p><p>8. For - Income elasticity of demand is indeed a measure of how responsive the demand for a good or service is to a change in income.</p><p>9. For - The law of supply states that if the price of something goes up, the quantity supplied will also go up. This is different from the law of demand.</p><p>10. For - The statement correctly describes the elasticity of demand as a measure of how demand reacts to price changes, which is calculated by dividing the percentage change in quantity demanded by the percentage change in price.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>yan po</p><p></p><br />

                            15. ONLY 5 QUESTIONS BUT READ THE STORY FIRST BEFORE ANSWERINGSTORY #1 The Donkey and the Mule A Peddler set off on his usual journey. All of the things he would sell along the way were packed on his donkey and his mule. The donkey walked along easily until they started up the steep mountain path. The poor little donkey’s load was more than he could bear. He begged the mule to take a little bit of his load, so that he could carry the rest more easily. But the mule paid no attention. At last they reached the top of the mountain where there was a small inn. The donkey was so exhausted that he fell to the ground. The next morning the donkey still could not get to his feet. Not knowing what else to do, the Peddler added the donkey’s load to the mule’s load, and went on without the donkey. The mule’s load was heavy, but his heart was even heavier. “If only I had helped the donkey just a little, I would not have a double load myself,” he reflected. STORY #2 The Peddler’s Mule A Peddler took his mule to the seacoast to buy salt. On the way home, they crossed a shallow stream where the mule accidentally slipped and fell. All of the salt in the bags dissolved, and the mule’s load was much lighter. The Peddler went back and bought even more salt than before. When they came to the stream, the mule fell down on purpose. When he got up, his load was again much lighter than before. The Peddler saw through the mule’s trick, and went back to the seacoast a third time. This time, instead of salt, he bought a cargo of sponges. Again, the mule fell down when they reached the stream. The sponges filled with water, and greatly increased his load. This time he had only tricked himself. THE QUESTIONS1. A Peddler goes on a trip. A. “The Donkey and the Mule” onlyB. Both storiesC. “The Peddler’s Mule” onlyD. Neither story2.

And with that, Alunsina suddenly disappeared, without a word or a trace to where she went. A few days passed, Tungkung Langit felt very lonely and longed for his wife. He realized that he should not have lost his temper. But it was too late, Ahunsina is gone. Their home which was once vibrant with Ahunsina's sweet voice, his home became cold and desolate. In the morning when he woke up, he would find himself alone. In the afternoon when he came home, he would feel loneliness creeping deep within him. sFor months Tungkung Langit lived in utter desolation. Try as he did he could not find Alunsina. And so in his desperation, he decided to do something to forget his sorrow and win back his wife's favor. So he came down to earth and planted trees and flowers that she may notice it, but she still didn't come home. Then in desperation, he took his wife's jewels and scattered them in the sky. He hoped that when Alunsina should see them she might be induced to return home. 6Ahnsina's necklace became the stars, her comb the moon, and her crown the sun. But in spite of all his efforts, Alunsina did not return home. Until now, as the story goes, Tungkung Langit lives alone in his palace in the skies and sometimes, he would cry out for Alunsina and his tears would fall down upon the earth as rain and his loud voice, calling out for his wife, was believed to be the thunder during storms, begging for her to come back to their heavenly palace once more. 5. Why did Tungkung Langit drive Ahunsina away? A. to change her B. because he is mad C. he is no longer in love with Alusina D. because she sent a spy to look for Tungkung Langit 6.

                            29.  Make a summary One Moment at Recess by Grace S. Ponce It was 10:00 in the morning at Mabuhay Elementary School. It's time to take a snack, it was recess time. Pupils are line up in waiting for their turns to go inside the canteen. Out of the crowd, Joselito seems down at the bench just looking around the kids eating and some are playing. He had no money to buy something because his father did not receive his salary yet. His mother told him to have a heavy breakfast for him to be full until lunch time.. While waiting for the time to pass by, he suddenly saw fifty pesos on the ground. He said to himself, "If I spend this money, I will be able to have lots to eat for recess." But, he knows that it is not the right thing to do. So, he goes to their classroom and asks for help from his adviser to find the owner of that money. It so happens that one of his classmates Irene was crying at the corner of their classroom because she lost her money. Joselito asks Irene how much she lost? "It's fifty pesos", said Irene. Joselito gives the fifty pesos that he saw to Irene and said, "I think it's yours." Irene was so thankful to Joselito. As a form of her appreciation, she told Joselito to go to the canteen with her and they shared snacks for recess. Joselito was grateful that because of his honesty, he was able to enjoy his recess time.nonsense: report ​</h2><br />

                            30. Story:Death of a Salesman (Summary) A stage play written by Arthur Miller Willy Loman returns home exhausted after a business trip he has cancelled. Worried over Willy's state of mind and recent car accident, his wife Linda suggests that he ask his boss Howard Wagner to allow him to work in his home city so he will not have to travel. Willy complains to Linda that their son, Biff, has yet to do something with his life. Despite Biff's potential as a football star in high school, he failed in mathematics and was therefore unable to enter a university. Biff and his younger brother, Happy, who is temporarily staying with Willy and Linda after Biff's unexpected return from the West, reminisce about their childhood together. They discuss their father's mental degeneration, which they have witnessed in the form of his constant indecisiveness and daydreaming about the boys' high school years. Eventually, Willy walks in, angry that the two boys have never amounted to anything. In an effort to pacify their father, Biff and Happy tell him that Biff plans to make a business proposition the next day. The next day, Willy goes to ask Howard for a job in town while Biff goes to make a business proposition, but they both fail; Willy gets angry and ends up getting fired when Howard tells him he needs a rest and can no longer represent the company, while Biff waits hours to see a former employer who does not remember him and turns him down. Biff impulsively steals a fountain pen. Willy then goes to the office of his neighbor Charley, where he runs into Charley's son Bernard, now a successful lawyer. Bernard tells him that Biff originally wanted to go to summer school to make up for failing math, but something happened in Boston when Biff went to visit his father that changed his mind. Charley gives the now-unemployed Willy money to pay his life-insurance premium, and Willy shocks Charley by remarking that ultimately, a man is "worth more dead than alive." Happy, Biff, and Willy meet for dinner at a restaurant, but Willy refuses to hear bad news from Biff. Happy tries to get Biff to lie to their father. Biff tries to tell him what happened as Willy gets angry and slips into a flashback of what happened in Boston the day Biff came to see him: Willy had been in Boston for work, and Biff went to visit him to ask Willy to convince his teacher to curve Biff's failing math grade. Willy was in the middle of an affair with a receptionist, when Biff arrived unexpectedly at the hotel room, and saw the woman, who was half-dressed. Willy attempted to explain away her presence as an innocent borrowing of his shower, while her own room was undergoing renovations, but Biff is unconvinced and angrily dismisses Willie as a liar and a fake before storming out. From that moment, Biff's views of his father changed and set him adrift. Biff leaves the restaurant in frustration, followed by Happy and two girls that Happy picked up, leaving a confused and upset Willy behind. When they later return home, Linda angrily confronts them for abandoning their father while Willy remains outside, talking to himself. Biff tries to reconcile with Willy, but the discussion quickly escalates into another argument. Biff conveys plainly to his father that he is not meant for anything great, insisting that both of them are simply ordinary men meant to lead ordinary lives. The argument reaches an apparent climax as Biff hugs Willy and begins to cry as he tries to get Willy to let go of his unrealistic expectations. Rather than listen to what Biff actually says, Willy appears to believe his son has forgiven him and will follow in his footsteps, and after Linda goes upstairs to bed, lapses one final time into a hallucination, thinking he is talking to his long-dead brother Ben. In Willy's mind, Ben approves of the scheme Willy has dreamed up to kill himself in order to give Biff his insurance policy money. Willy exits the house, and Biff and Linda cry out in despair as the sound of Willy's car blares up and fades out. The final scene takes place at Willy's funeral, which is attended only by his family, Charley and Bernard. The ambiguities of mixed and unaddressed emotions persist, particularly over whether Willy's choices or circumstances were obsolete. At the funeral, Biff retains his belief that he does not want to become a businessman like his father. Happy, on the other hand, chooses to follow in his father's footsteps, while Linda laments her husband's decision just before her final payment on the house. QUESTION:1. How would you describe Willy as a father?2. What can you tell about the relationship of the family to each other?3. What led Willy to commit suicide?
