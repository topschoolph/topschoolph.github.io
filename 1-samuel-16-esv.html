                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>Ano ang 1 Samuel 16:7?</strong><p>Ngunit sinabi sa kanya ni Yahweh, “Huwag mong tingnan ang kanyang taas at kakisigan sapagkat hindi siya ang pinili ko. Si Yahweh'y hindi tumitingin nang katulad ng pagtingin ng tao. Panlabas na anyo ang tinitingnan ng tao ngunit sa puso tumitingin si Yahweh.”</p><p></p><strong>Repleksiyon ng 1 Samuel 16:7</strong><p>Ang Diyos ay hindi tumitingin sa labas na kaanyuhan ng isang tao. Hindi ang kakisigan, hindi ang yaman, hindi ang talento o ano pa man na kayang ipagmayabang bilang isang tao. Ang Diyos ay tumitingin lamang sa laman ng ating puso. Sa kabutihan ng ating puso at sa nilalaman nito. Hindi natin kailangan mainggit  sa iba sapagkat lahat ng iyon ay wala sa harapan ng Diyos kung ang kanilang puso ay hindi mabuti at kung ang kanilang buhay ay wala sa ating Diyos. Panatilihin natin na malinis ang ating mga puso at maayos ang ating mga buhay. Tayo ay mamuhay ng may takot sa Diyos at ginagawa ang mga bagay na karapatdapat sa kanyang harapan. </p><p></p><p>Kung nais mo pang makabasa ng mga bible verses, maaari mo ring i-click ang mga links na ito:</p>Bible verse tagalog at paliwanag: https://brainly.ph/question/1113458Verse Bible and explain the verse kahit Tagalog: https://brainly.ph/question/713761<p></p><p><strong>#LetsStudy</strong></p><br />

                        Answer<p><strong>1 Samuel 1:27</strong></p><p>"I prayed for this child, and the Lord has granted me what I asked of him."</p><p></p><p>Throughout years of infertility, Hannah faithfully kept on praying to God until God gave her and Elkanah a Son. They named him Samuel, who, in the years to come, became the prophet who anointed King Saul and King David. Hannah knew that without God, Samuel would have not been born. So, with this truth in her heart. She became a good parent by preparing Samuel, at a very young age, to serve and know more about the Lord in the Tabernacle at Shiloh.</p>Explanation<p>To further understand, let us discuss a little bit about Hebrew culture in the times of the Old Testament. First, It is a disgrace to have no Children because it would discontinue the bloodline. Second, being a servant in the Lord's Tabernacle is considered a great honor among the Israelites.</p><p>So, with this information, we could say that Hannah was preparing Samuel for the best life, serving and being friendly with the Lord.</p><p></p><p><strong>Is the Bible Real? - </strong>brainly.ph/question/2903514</p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Lord heard her prayer and she bore a child whom she named Samuel. Once Samuel was weaned (about age three), she took him to the temple, saying, “I have granted him to Yahweh. As long as he lives he is granted to Yahweh” (1:28). She then prayed a prayer that would later serve as a model for Mary’s Magnificat (2:1-10; Luke 1:46-55).</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Maybe that's right?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>And the Lord appeared again in Shiloh: for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord.</p><br />

According to Kimchi, it is as if it was Saulmeel; that is, "asked of God", and by contraction Samuel; but Hillerus F3 gives a better account of this name, and takes it to be composed of Saul-mul-el, "asked before God", "in the sight of God", "before the ark of God". This name Hannah gave her son (for sometimes the father, and sometimes the mother, gave the name) in memory of the wonderful favour and goodness of God in granting her request; and to impress her own mind with a sense of the obligation she lay under, to perform her vow, and to engage her son the more readily to give up himself to the service of God, when he reflected on his name, and the reason of it.</p><p> </p><p></p><br />

Ahimelek trembled when he met him, and asked, “Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?”</p><p></p><p><strong>2 </strong>David answered Ahimelek the priest, “The king sent me on a mission and said to me, ‘No one is to know anything about the mission I am sending you on.’ As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place. 3 Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you can find.”</p><p></p><p>4 But the priest answered David, “I don’t have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread here—provided the men have kept themselves from women.”</p><p></p><p>5 David replied, “Indeed women have been kept from us, as usual whenever[b] I set out. The men’s bodies are holy even on missions that are not holy. How much more so today!” 6 So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the Lord and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away.</p><p></p><p>7 Now one of Saul’s servants was there that day, detained before the Lord; he was Doeg the Edomite, Saul’s chief shepherd.</p><p></p><p>8 David asked Ahimelek, “Don’t you have a spear or a sword here? I haven’t brought my sword or any other weapon, because the king’s mission was urgent.”</p><p></p><p>9 The priest replied, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it; there is no sword here but that one.”</p><p></p><p>David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”</p><p></p><p>David at Gath</p><p>10 That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath. 11 But the servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David, the king of the land? Isn’t he the one they sing about in their dances:</p><p></p><p>“‘Saul has slain his thousands,</p><p>    and David his tens of thousands’?”</p><p></p><p>12 David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath. 13 So he pretended to be insane in their presence; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard.</p><p></p><p>14 Achish said to his servants, “Look at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me? 15 Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?”</p><p></p><p>David at Adullam and Mizpah</p><p>22 David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father’s household heard about it, they went down to him there. 2 All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their commander. About four hundred men were with him.</p><p></p><p>3 From there David went to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab, “Would you let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God will do for me?” 4 So he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David was in the stronghold.</p><p></p><p>5 But the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold. Go into the land of Judah.” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.</p><p></p><p>Saul Kills the Priests of Nob</p><p>6 Now Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. And Saul was seated, spear in hand, under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with all his officials standing at his side. 7 He said to them, “Listen, men of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds? 8 Is that why you have all conspired against me? No one tells me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is concerned about me or tells me that my son has incited my servant to lie in wait for me, as he does today.”</p><p></p><p>9 But Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with Saul’s officials, said, “I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelek son of Ahitub at Nob. 10 Ahimelek inquired of the Lord for him; he also gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”</p><p></p><p>11 Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelek son of Ahitub and all the men of his family, who were the priests at Nob, and they all came to the king. 12 Saul said, “Listen now, son of Ahitub.”</p><p></p><p>“Yes, my lord,” he answered.</p><p></p><p>13 Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him, so that he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me, as he does today?”</p><p></p><p>14 Ahimelek answered the king, “Who of all your servants is as loyal as David, the king’s son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard and highly respected in your household? 15 Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of his father’s family, for your servant knows nothing at all about this whole affair.”</p><p></p><p>16 But the king said, “You will surely die, Ahimelek, you and your whole family.”</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>This is long but hope is Helped</strong></p><p></p><p>#LetsStudyLearners!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

God was patient with Samuel; finally, Samuel understood and listened to what God was telling him. God patiently calls us, too. God calls us to listen to him and understand what he wants us to do<br /><br />6. So Eli told Samuel, "Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, `Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening<br /><br />7. Samuel, Hebrew Shmuʾel, (flourished 11th century bc, Israel), religious hero in the history of Israel, represented in the Old Testament in every role of leadership open to a Jewish man of his day—seer, priest, judge, prophet, and military leader.<br /><br />8. Samuel!" Then Samuel said, "Speak, for your servant is listening." And the LORD said to Samuel: "See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle. At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family--from beginning to end</p><p></p><p>9. So Eli told Samuel, "Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, `Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening. '" So Samuel went and lay down in his place<br /><br />10. Samuel was an honest and fair judge, dispensing God's law impartially. As a prophet, he exhorted Israel to turn from idolatry and serve God alone. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>brainliest  pls</p><br />

                        <strong>REFLECTION ABOUT 1 SAMUEL 16:7</strong><p></p><strong>1 Samuel 16:17</strong><p>But the <strong>Lord </strong>said to Samuel, “Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The <strong>Lord</strong> does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the <strong>Lord </strong>looks at the heart.”</p><p>This is what I think in the verse I've read,  most of us are like Samuel, we are easily  to choose based on our standards, we are easily deceived by the beautiful appearance of others and forget to look how kind the person is. Like for example, inside the Church, Sometimes we see other people who are clothes with beautiful dress and concluded that they have more offerings to give but actually not true and those who are in clothes with simple have nothing to give, maybe small but they are generous. Therefore, the<strong> Lord</strong> teach us not to be like Samuel instead, we should be like our <strong>Lord</strong> who looks in the heart so that we can avoid to easily judge others because of their appearance.</p><p></p><p>brainly.ph/question/19086773</p><p>#LETSTUDY</p><br />
