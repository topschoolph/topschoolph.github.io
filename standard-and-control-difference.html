                                            64 tudent B: After studying residents and staff from two intermediate care facilities in Calgary, Alberta, Smith (2000) came to the conclusion that except for the amount of personal privacy available to residents, the physical environment of these institutions had minimal if any effect on their perceptions of control (autonomy). However, French (1998) and Haroon (2000) found that availability of private areas is not the only aspect of the physical environment that determines residents' autonomy. Haroon interviewed 115 residents from 32 different nursing homes known to have different levels of autonomy (2000). It was found that physical structures, such as standardized furniture, heating that could not be individually regulated, and no possession of a house key for residents limited their feelings of independence. Moreover, Hope (2002), who interviewed 225 residents from various nursing homes, substantiates the claim that characteristics of the institutional environment such as the extent of resources in the facility, as well as its location, are features which residents have indicated as being of great importance to their independence.​</a>

If a device is visibly wet with oil, it may attract particles that can cause internalwear of certain parts4. If the device's measurement differs from the standard to a significant degree, youwill not need to repair the instrument so it is accurate.5. Once the work space is de-cluttered and organized, dirt and grime cannotbe removed6. It's essential that you follow proper care and maintenance procedures with all ofyour measuring tools7. Lubrication is a critical element of measuring tool care, as these devices can spendsignificant amounts of time in cupboards or cabinets where they may get damaged8. Cleaning your devices is crucial, as any residue that remains on your device mayimpact the accuracy of your measurements.9. Calibration involves comparing a measurement made by your instrument with thevalue of the same measurement, as defined by an accepted standard.10.

                            25. 64 tudent B: After studying residents and staff from two intermediate care facilities in Calgary, Alberta, Smith (2000) came to the conclusion that except for the amount of personal privacy available to residents, the physical environment of these institutions had minimal if any effect on their perceptions of control (autonomy). However, French (1998) and Haroon (2000) found that availability of private areas is not the only aspect of the physical environment that determines residents' autonomy. Haroon interviewed 115 residents from 32 different nursing homes known to have different levels of autonomy (2000). It was found that physical structures, such as standardized furniture, heating that could not be individually regulated, and no possession of a house key for residents limited their feelings of independence. Moreover, Hope (2002), who interviewed 225 residents from various nursing homes, substantiates the claim that characteristics of the institutional environment such as the extent of resources in the facility, as well as its location, are features which residents have indicated as being of great importance to their independence.​</h2><br />
